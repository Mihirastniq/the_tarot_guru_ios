The young man has a white rose flower in his hand. A bitch is jumping behind him.\r\nLooking at the young man it seems that he himself has not yet gained complete knowledge. Many shades of nature are scattered in front of him. There is an open sky in front and in that open environment, there are many expressions of mystery on the face of the young man.\r\nIn front of the young man is the symbol of the sun rising on the horizon, which symbolizes the young man's conscious soul. This indicates that this soul does not reach the pinnacle of perfection in just one birth. To achieve rise, development, progress and perfection in life, one has to go through many births.",

The picture of Garuda made on the bag hanging at the end of the stick shows the unlimited efforts of the young man. Along with that one also realizes his unlimited power.\r\nThe rose in the young man's hand represents his pure intelligence. Looking at him it seems that worldly inferiority or deceit has not yet entered his mind. The bitch jumping behind him represents his violent tendencies. It appears from this that after crossing the animal life, one can reach a higher level with human companionship. Also, looking at the picture, it seems that he wants to achieve development and progress by being a constant trend. To support him, the consciousness of nature is continuously providing support.",
