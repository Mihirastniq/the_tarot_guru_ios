        "card_content": "A fool is one who, despite being deceived again and again, does not learn anything from his past experiences. A fool is one who keeps trusting others even after being deceived at every step. You deceive him again and again, he will trust you every time. Ultimately you will call him a 'fool'.\n\nHe is a fool because even after you cheat him again and again, his trust in you is beyond limits. Remember one thing here, he is a fool only until he has some kind of knowledge. What the so-called intelligent and knowledgeable people cannot understand, the fool can understand, Because the cunningness and cleverness of the wise close his mind. A fool's faith and trust reach such a level that you betray him, but his trust in you will not waver in the slightest.\n\nYou too can become a fool according to your understanding of 'Tao' and 'Zen', but be careful not to build a wall of knowledge around yourself. After that, whatever experience you have, let it happen and then leave it there. Feel yourself healthy and refreshed. Similarly, forget the sad incidents of your past that have happened continuously and try to live in the present. Make every day of your life feel new and happy, In the same way as a newborn baby would feel.\n\nOsho says, 'Welcome into the Kingdom of God those who are like little children, Not little children!' Little children cannot enter there. They still have to pass through the worldly path, They have to taste worldly poison, which they will mistake for 'nectar'! After that they will start on the path of making themselves pure and pure. That experience will be enough for him. Therefore, only people 'not little children', 'like little children' are eligible to realize God. That is, those people who have child-like innocence, like a fool!\n\nRemember one thing, it is not easy to have a child-like mentality or a fool-like innocence. It will be very difficult for you to do this in the beginning, but not impossible. The world will take advantage of you by considering you a fool. He will serve his selfish interest by making you a medium, but you should be rest assured. Let them do that. How poor and helpless such people are! Even if you have been cheated in the past, Even if they have been robbed again and again, Yet you allow it to happen, Do not retaliate. No one can take away what is truly yours. No one can steal what is truly yours.\n",
        "card_description": "At every moment, at every step, the fool leaves behind his past experiences. He doesn't learn anything from the events of his past. If anything remains with her, it is only her innocence, purity and faith – symbolizes by the white rose in her hand. As a sample, the colors of 'Tarot' are visible in the form of four elements on his 'waistcoat'. This indicates that he is completely 'peaceful' surrounded by the coordinated unity of all four elements. At this time the power of his intuition is at its peak. At this moment it seems as if the power of the entire universe has entered inside that fool! He is so full of self-confidence that he is ready to take a leap into the unknown.\n\nThe card informs that if you consistently trust the power of your intuition, you will never make a wrong decision. It is possible that your actions may seem foolish to others, It is also possible that you too think the same way. But this can happen only when you analyze it with a rational mind. For the fool the place of 'zero' is a calculation without any number, where his faith and his innocence are his guide, and not his past experience and disbelief!\n",

Existence needs you, You are not separate from it, we cannot separate from existence even if we want to. The deeper we connect with existence, the deeper our life will become. Existence is incomplete without you. No one can complete it except you. What a matter of great pride for you that the entire existence is incomplete without you! This is what you were born for.\n\nThe moment you feel that in every moment, every breath and every heartbeat you are feeling the joy of newness, new youth and revival, At that time you will be filled with extraordinary happiness and amazing happiness! At that time everything, even the sun, moon, stars, trees, plants, birds, animals etc., So much so that this entire universe will experience incompleteness in existence. No one will be able to complete it without you.\n\nThe entire existence is full of joy and happiness. You need to open the windows of your mind! The shadow darkness in your mind is not someone else's creation, but your creation. Disharmony, lack of communication or hatred towards a particular person is created by you only. You recognize this truth. You are not a stranger to yourself. You are not unfamiliar with the trees, mountains, rivers etc. of this creation, nor are you unknown to them. This is our existence and we are a part of existence.\n\nThe heartbeat of our heart is part of the heartbeat of this universe. Once you become clear, calm and certain in your mind and brain, at that moment you will realize your existence. At that time you will feel a wonderful joy, immense love will be showered on you from all sides.\n",
        "card_description": "This naked figure is sitting on a lotus leaf, contentedly, gazing at the beauty of the night sky. She knows that 'home' is not a physical place in the outer world, but only inner peace and an accepting quality. Just as there are moon, stars, mountains, rivers, trees, flowers, animals, birds etc. in this universe, in the same way we too are a living part of the existence of the universe. These are all our brothers and sisters in the dance of life!\n\nWe should not take human aspirations personally but should continuously strive to achieve holistic existence. Existence is always under our care, you do not need to believe in any 'saviour' or any angel. These are all the desires of the child's mind. To believe in Jesus Christ to be free from suffering is only an imaginary attitude. In fact, this universe has a complete existence. The one who operates or protects this world is its own existence. You are a part of this existence.\n\nAs a result of our struggle for personal achievements and fulfilment of personal aspirations, we have forgotten nature. The concept that nature is far away from us or that we are separate from nature is a product of our mind.\n\nYou are standing at that point in time, Where you have to realize if you are ready to accept that extraordinary gift, Which place makes you feel at home? If your response is affirmative, then enjoy every moment of your life, be proud of your overall existence. Feel yourself a unit of existence in this living universe, and then see your life filled with the eternal inner being.\n",

        "card_content": "If you have found the truth within yourself, If you have recognized your inner voice, So you need not look for anything else in this total existence, After attaining this truth there is no need to attain anything else. The truth is being edited by you. When you open your eyes, truth opens its eyes. When you close your eyes, truth also closes its eyes.\n\nIt's a terrible experiment, a complicated meditation. If you understand this generally, then there is nothing else left for you to do, whatever you are doing is done through the truth. You are walking, that is the truth. When you sleep, truth rests, Whatever you speak speaks the truth. You are silent, that truth is silent. You feel silence and peace, that is the feeling of truth.\n\nThe moment you feel silent peace, that is the truth. That is silence! Silent peace means there is no sound inside you! Absent all types of sounds, all types of sounds originate from the brain. In this void, your conscience propels you towards a certain direction. This guidance is not given through words or anyone's voice. This signal is wordless, completely silent, Otherwise it would have been absolutely impossible to find out the truth as to what is the inner voice? Hence it is clear that no sound comes out in words from within.\n\nIn fact, when all kinds of sounds in the conscience become almost dead or complete silence prevails, in that situation your conscience becomes so capable that it can take your hand and go wherever it wants. The experience of silent silence of the conscience can be called a type of general meditation or yoga method. By this simple method, gradually everything gets organized for you. Later you no longer need any other technique. All your confusions come to an end.\n\nWhen you become comfortable with this type of method and feel complete inner health, then you leave the 'meditation' method, And stop using medicines. You reach a state where you can live life as truth. You do not need any kind of memory system to survive. Truth originates from the conscience, Whereas reaction is the product of the brain. When your life becomes the truth of the conscience, you will experience divine joy, fullness and freedom from your entire life. Life will become a musical prayer. Such music, whose sound cannot be heard! A prayer that has no words!\n",
        "card_description": "The inner voice does not come out in words, There are no words for the language of the heart. The voice of the conscience is exactly like the voice of the sky or divine voice, it is true. If it had a face, it would be like the one in the middle of this card, Fully aware, alert and so capable. He is holding crystals with both his hands as a symbol. That crystal automatically expresses its purity and innocence, which goes beyond the prescribed limits and is received from the soul and God. The inner voice may also be playful or cheerful, Because sometimes she dives into the depths of emotions and sometimes she breaks all the bonds and goes further to the sky. This process is linked to the ordered world, In the picture, the crescent-shaped crown and the earth are represented by green leaves.\n\nSuch times often come in our lives, When we get attracted towards different types of sounds. In such a situation, all our confusions seem to remind us that amidst such noise, we need to remain calm and self-centered. Only then can we hear the truth within us.\n",

        "card_content": "Creativity is a special characteristic of human beings, What activates you toward a particular activity, But this happens only when there is absence of ego in your conscience. When you yourself remain carefree, When your desires are completely calm, in such a situation some unknown force makes you anxious to become active towards activities. This is a special state, where you have an inner presence. In other words, that is your internal approach, how you see things. Not every person can be a painter and there is no need either. If everyone became a painter, this beautiful world would become very ugly, Where it becomes difficult for us to live. In the same way, not every person can be a dancer, there is no need for him, But every person can be an initiator.\n\nCreation can be done only by being in tune with the sound of existence. The moment you are creating something, be it a poem, a song, a music, a dance or whatever, you are included in existence, In other words at that time you become a part of existence. You cannot remain separated from the existence of this living universe for long. In fact, you disappear from existence in those moments and existence starts creating through you.\n\nWhatever you do, if you do it cheerfully, if you do it lovingly, If what you are creating is not economic, So that will be called your creation or that is your creativity. If the creativity sprouting in your heart wants to develop. So that is spirituality, it is called divine. The more creative you become, the more divine you become.\n\nIt is said in all the religions of the world that the creator of this universe is God. I don't know whether God is the creator or not, but I definitely know that the more creative you become, the more divine you will become. When your creativity reaches its peak, when your entire life becomes creative, then your life becomes divine. Therefore, God must definitely be the creator, Because the more creative a man becomes, the more divine potential develops within him.\n\nSo whatever you create, do it with love. Keep yourself as the mediator during creation.\n",
        "card_description": "With divine light entering from above into the chemistry of fire and water below, the figure in the card is literally under the creative power. In fact, the experience of creativity is a kind of entry into esotericism. Technical skills and knowledge are the means of creation. Its key is under the sole power of, From which every thing is born. This power has no shape or form, yet all types of forms or shapes are created from the same power.\n\nIt does not matter what type of creation it is. The creation can be of painting or music, gardening or even cooking. The most important thing is the surgeon who performed your surgery, Has it achieved the shape you want or not? Just remember that your creation is not under you. His existence is not based on you. Creation is not related to us. True creativity arises in cooperation with the divine, Secretly, that which is beyond knowledge, then becomes a joy to the creator and a blessing to others.\n",

        "card_content": "The situation of a rebel is dreadfully exciting. Every moment he has to face different types of problems, Because society has a system, a certain method and certain ideals. A rebel – or we can also call him a revolutionary – cannot follow those ideals and methods. He has to follow his own conscious voice.\n\nPeople are extremely afraid of people who have identified themselves. Such revolutionary persons have a certain power, a certain aura and magnetism, due to which the youth gets influenced by coming out of the circle of traditions and following them. The revolutionary does not repeat the past in the present. He wants to bring something new into the world. Those people, who have hidden from the world and society, are called escapists or cowards. They have actually turned away from their responsibilities towards the country and society. But they do not understand that the moment they run away from their responsibilities, their freedom also disappears. These are the complexities of life, and this is the complexity of life that freedom and responsibilities both stay together or go away together.\n\nThose people who are self-conscious, no power can subjugate them, No one can enslave them. Those who have attained enlightenment are the biggest strangers in this world. Looking at them it does not seem that they can be associated with anyone. No institution, no society, no nation can imprison them, they cannot be kept within limits, Because they are revolutionaries, Want to move away from dilapidated traditions and do something new for the society and nation!\n",
        "card_description": "The figure of a powerful and influential person seen in the card clearly indicates that the person is the creator of his own destiny. The reflection of the sun falling on his shoulder and him holding a torch in his right hand, symbolizes that the person has achieved the light of truth by destroying various types of traditions and rotten orthodox beliefs through his own efforts. A truth in the light of which it is capable of providing something new. Whether he is rich or poor, he is an emperor in the true sense of the word! He is his own king, Because till now he was kept tied by the chains of oppression and tyranny by the society. He has broken those chains with his strong morale and self-power.\n\nThat person has spread his wings to come out of the darkness and fly high in the sky through some invisible path, absorbing all the colors of the rainbow. Not because he is a traitor or a revolutionary, not because he is fighting against anyone or anything. In fact, because he has discovered his true nature and has determined to live accordingly. Garuda is the symbol of his enthusiasm, the messenger between earth and sky. The revolutionary challenges us to become as enthusiastic as him and fulfil the responsibility of living for the truth.\n\nThe revolutionary person becomes powerful and challenges us to assume and fulfil all the responsibilities. Along with that it challenges us to live the truth. A self-conscious person cannot be made a slave. Every talented person who has learned something finds it a little difficult to accept it. That person was in bondage till now, now his bonds have been broken. He cannot come under anyone's pressure.\n",

        "card_content": "There is no word capable of 'nothingness' in the English language, But Buddha has chosen a very powerful word, 'emptiness'! The word that can come close to it in the English language is -nothingness, but the word is not as beautiful and capable of expressing emotions as 'nothingness!'\n\nThe goal of 'meditation' is to create emptiness within you. But this 'emptiness' has nothing to do with negative thoughts, There is abundance in this emptiness and such abundance is exciting. There is so much excitement in this abundance that it starts overflowing, It starts spilling out. Buddha described such a state of emptiness as an overflowing flow of kindness and compassion.\n\nTherefore, we should create such 'void' within ourselves, Because such emptiness does not mean 'nothing'. It is very irritating due to excessive abundance.\n\nSuch a void which is completely empty creates invisible fear in man. If the void created within you is empty, it is negative, So that is like death for you. Such emptiness creates darkness inside you. Where there is no happiness, no joy! In such emptiness there is neither song, nor music, nor dance, nor is there any beat in the heart. What it means to say is that your life is completely like hell. Then why do you suffer hell-like tortures in such a state of emptiness?\n",
        "card_description": "A state of emptiness can create a state of darkness and fear in the conscience. In such a situation nothing can be grasped, There is no path or direction in any direction. There is not even a hint of one's choice and the possibilities of achieving it. This was exactly the situation after the creation of the universe, From which there was immense potential to emerge and come into existence.\n\nAll you have to do is feel comfortable in this state of emptiness. Similarly, emptiness is in a state of absolutely silent peace, like in the state between two words or between inhaling and exhaling! In this situation, accumulate every free moment in which something new is going to arise. Remember here that 'emptiness' does not mean 'nothing'. The general meaning of emptiness is that it is complete. Here 'thing' means object. An object has a definite shape. Therefore, the meaning of nothingness is that it never means emptiness.\n\nEmptiness can have a definite meaning that there is something, rather than nothing at all. When the size of an object is fixed then that object becomes limited in its size. It cannot be called unlimited. Once we accept something or find its alternative, there too a definite shape emerges in the brain. All this is achieved after reaching the depth of meditation. This is the reality of human life.\n\nThoughts emerge in a state of emptiness. They have a fixed shape and then when the thought changes, that shape disappears again. It cannot be hidden anywhere. Watch it take shape and even watch it disappear. Therefore, here zero cannot be used to mean 'nothing'.\n\nThus meditation is the medium to enter emptiness.\n",

        "card_content": "Remember these three things – There are three stages of love. The lowest level of love is 'sex', which is physical. The pure and highest level of love is 'compassion'. Hence 'sex' is below love and compassion is above love. The state between these two (sex and compassion) is love. Very few people know what love really is? In the eyes of others, love is madness. This is the viewpoint of people who don't even know what love is! Ninety-nine out of a hundred people unfortunately think that sex is love, but it is not so. Sexual pleasure is full of animality. Although love may develop from it, it is not love.\n\nSexual pleasure can be transformed into love, But for that you have to be alert and alert, One has to become meditative by immersing himself in deep meditation. When your intensity becomes pure and sacred, you will feel that it transforms into love, compassion. To achieve physical pleasure, love based on physical beauty is momentary and brute, not permanent. Sex is like a seed, In which the flower in the growing plant is like love. Love is the fragrance spread by the flower of compassion!\n\nWhile explaining compassion, Buddha has said – “Compassion is the combination of love and meditation.” When your love does not desire anything from anyone, When your love is no longer just a need or selfishness, When your love is meant to be shared with others, When your love is not a beggar, but a king, an emperor, When your love does not ask for anything in return, Instead of this, you are ready to give everything to others, you are feeling happy by sharing your inner happiness with others, at that time you should include 'Meditation' in your love. You will feel the divine fragrance that spreads from it. That is compassion, a wonderful thing compassion!\n\nThe fragrance of love spreads in the form of compassion, But in such love, intimacy is necessary. Intimacy exists only where there is closeness. Where there is close and intimate attachment, we allow others to look into our inner self, so that they can reach into the depths of our heart and try to know us. In the modern era intimacy is gradually disappearing, The reason for this is that there is nothing in a person's heart that he can share with others. There is no love in such a heart, there is disorder and ego. Love is the only goal of life's journey. Once your goals are clear, your inner prosperity will begin to develop. All the wounds of the heart will blossom into lotuses. This is the secret of love and this is the magic of love. Love is the most powerful chemical in the world. The person who knows how to use the chemical of love reaches the pinnacle of success.",
        "card_description": "What we call love is actually a web of relationships. Like a rainbow which keeps reflecting from the earth to the sky. If seen at the physical level, love is a caste attraction. Most of us have this level of love. The reason for this is that our sexual attraction remains suppressed under the burden of our circumstances and expectations. Love which is based on sexual attraction never ends. This is the biggest problem of such love. If we accept this reality, we can truly enjoy sexual love, For whom it is! And when he is not there, say goodbye with gratitude.\n\nWhen we become accustomed and mature to this process, we can begin to experience such love. Love that exists outside of sexual attraction, A love that is full of self-respect for each other in the entire universe. Gradually we begin to understand that our partner often acts like a mirror, revealing a deep reflection of our inner feelings. There are no expectations or selfishness in this kind of love, there are no requirements, such love is completely free. His wings take us to the other side of this universe and make us feel one with the beloved.\n",

Although the flow of awareness flows only through your brain, Yet it is not a part of the brain. The mutual relationship between awareness and the brain is like an electric bulb. Electricity flows through the bulb, but it is not a part of the bulb. If you break a bulb, the flow of electricity will certainly be interrupted, but its power is hidden invisibly. You insert the new bulb, it will light up immediately and the electric current will start again.\n\nIn this way we can say that the brain is like a machine. Awareness is not a part of the brain, rather awareness flows through the brain. The brain puts you into a state of paranoia, A kind of situation of inertia is created. Memories of the past become a burden on the mind. You continue to live, but with minimum expectations of life, not the maximum. The torch of awareness within you becomes dim, Because your mind is filled with the garbage of past thoughts, the light of the torch burning within you has dimmed. Clear away those thoughts of the past that you have collected in your mind like layers of dust, The torch that has dimmed within you will shine again.\n\nYou use your brain to dream, imagine and go crazy. You did not use it correctly, You cut off its wings. If you use its feather, then true knowledge can enter within you and that can be called enlightenment. But that is also a part of the brain. That's kind of a ride. The experimenter remains behind. It cannot be used. You use your brain, Because you are aware.\n\nYou can know this only when your brain stops working. That is, stop having different types of thoughts. In such a situation you become aware. You begin to feel as if you are filled with awareness. The brain is a ride for you, you can ride on it whenever you want.\n\nNow you have become completely aware. Whatever you do, be determined not to do 'it'. Be fully aware and keep an eye on your every action, every thought and every experience. Look and move with it. Every moment of yours is precious. Do not destroy it under the influence of laziness. If you face every moment of your life considering it as a challenge, then amazing consciousness will arise inside you, this consciousness will increase day by day and one day suddenly you will feel that an invisible light has lit up inside you.

As soon as the curtain on your mind is removed, the innocent face of a very delicate child becomes visible, It can be called a form of intelligence. Gradually awareness starts developing within you. This development of awareness is not the result of doing anything in consciousness. Nor do you need to struggle to make anything happen! Till now you have been groping and searching for something in the darkness of the past, but now that darkness is going away. Allow yourself to be still and remember that deep within your soul lies a sense of evidence. Constantly silent, awake and unchangeable. By breaking the boundaries of inner activity, a medium is now opening for you that reaches the center of witnessing located deep within your mind. This medium will help you to become detached and detached and a new awareness will remove the curtains from your eyes.",

Because life means contact with existence... a harmonious connection. And that seed is dead, Which has no contact with the earth, No contact with sky, wind, sun, moon, stars etc. Till now this seed has not set any goal of establishing communication with existence.

Still, that sprout starts moving towards something invisible unknowingly. Towards the sun, towards the source of light, but he doesn't know where he wants to go? And why? Yet his dream inspires him and the seed springs into action.\n\nLike seeds, human life also has characteristics. Don't remain a mere seed and remain in a dark tunnel separated from existence. Gather courage and abandon your ego, Dare to take off your guard, Give up all conveniences, Offer yourself to face external attacks and the arrival of terrible sorrows. But don't remain just a tree. A tree which cannot provide shade, Could not give fragrance of flowers, Couldn't give the sweetness of fruits! A tree that does not bear flowers looks so poor! A tree without flowers is absolutely poor and empty. A tree devoid of flowers loses all that is necessary for survival. She has no beauty, Because beauty arises from love.

The indomitable courage of the seed till it turns into a beautiful flower inspires mankind to awaken its identity and protect its existence. The process of germination of a seed lying in the dark inside the soil, breaking through impenetrable rocks and stones, coming out into the light of day and mingling with existence, is the result of extraordinary courage, It is a symbol of the small seed's huge heart and its greatness. A flower guides us in that its intense passion for life gives us the courage to come out of the darkness of despair and inaction and into the light.\n\nWe have no other way except to fight or face the challenges of life, Or there is no point in running away, hiding or denying those challenges. If that seed, with indomitable courage and struggling with adverse circumstances, can flourish on the earth, then why can't we? So gather courage and face all the challenges like a flower and fill the world with your fragrance and beauty.",

        "card_content": "There are some activities which can be done alone. Love, prayer, birth, death, aesthetics, moments of blessedness etc. happen when you are alone. But who wants to be alone? No one. The biggest fear in this world is 'loneliness'. People can endure thousands of hardships, But cannot bear loneliness.\n\nWhen you are alone, you keep thinking about others. Loneliness is a negative state. In such a situation, different types of thoughts keep arising in your mind. In such a situation, such thoughts arise in your mind that at this time, it would have been better if you had a friend, your wife, your loved one, your mother or your husband. But nothing like that happens.\n\nLoneliness is felt only when there is no direct or indirect presence of anyone around you. But when you become part of a crowd, when you become part of devotees in a temple, church and mosque, you do not feel lonely. At that time you feel at ease.\n\nThe experience of loneliness in this world is truly a great miracle. This means that at that time you are not affiliated with any temple, mosque, church or any institution. Try to understand this situation. You are born alone and die alone. Both these moments are the greatest moments of life. Life begins and ends with loneliness.\n\nThere is a lot of difference between loneliness and isolation. Loneliness reveals the absence of others and solitude reveals its own presence. Loneliness is extremely positive. In loneliness you feel so complete within yourself that you can fill the entire universe with your presence, where no one else is needed.\n",
        "card_description": "When there is no one else in our life in any sense, at that time we either feel lonely or we experience freedom in that solitude. When we receive no support from others, we either experience loneliness or bitterness as a result of the deeper truths within us. Or there is no need for the consent of your friends, family members, and colleagues, In this way, we enjoy truth by remaining steadfast in our approach. If you are also facing this type of situation, then now is the time, you should become alert and determine your new attitude towards your 'loneliness'. Thus, fulfil your responsibilities with a new perspective. For that, strengthen your internal capacity.\n\nThe humble figure depicted in this card is spreading the aura emanating from within her everywhere. One of the meaningful teachings of Gautam Buddha is on the spiritual condition of human life.\n\n'Become your own light.' In the end, we all have to make the truth within us so powerful, acquire so much capability within ourselves that without anyone's support, cooperation or guidance, we can come out of darkness and come into light and move ahead alone on the path of development.\n",

        "card_content": "Only the entry of something new inside you can transform you, Otherwise there is no other way for change or transformation.\n\nThe cycle of change in life continues continuously. Life keeps chasing death and death keeps chasing life. The changing cycle of time! Happiness is followed by sorrow and sorrow is followed by happiness, Love is always followed by hate and hate is always followed by love. Success is followed by failure and failure is followed by success. Lord Buddha has called the continuous flow of life and death as 'the cycle of life and death'.\n\nAny newness does not arise from within you, it always comes from outside. You have already formed a pattern for living your life. You are hesitant in bringing any change or there is an invisible fear. While adopting any new thing, you do not want to forget your previous life. You want to live your life on one path, Because you believe in him. But when something new knocks at your door, your previous way of life starts to fall into disarray. If you accept any new idea or any new system in your life, then that newness transforms you and you experience change in yourself.\n\nOne thing is worth noting here. By accepting any newness in life, you will feel confused in yourself, Because you don't know where and how the new path will end. The past part of your life is familiar, You have been colored in the same color for a long time. The new is completely unknown to you. The new can be your friend as well as your enemy. Only by accepting newness can you get the opportunity to recognize and assimilate it. You can't ignore this new path too much, Because your old way of living your previous life could not give you what you are looking for! Your previous way of life is not unknown to you, but it is certainly pitiful.\n\nNow the question arises that how can our new transformation take place? Generally everyone wants to become new. This requires courage. Courage is also not ordinary, Requires extraordinary courage. There is no newness within us which we can present outside and experience newness in ourselves. Newness comes from outside only. Any newness enters from existence. The human brain always remains old. The brain is never new. Newness is a wonderful gift of existence that comes from outside.\n\nThe moment you accept the newness deep within your being, there can be a complete transformation in you, which can also be called a complete transformation. You cannot bring change in your life yourself, you cannot bring any newness from within yourself. Newness in you always comes from outside. You can either accept that newness or reject it. If you reject Him, you will remain no more than a mere stone statue, completely abstract or dead. If you accept the new, it can make you as soft and fragrant as a flower, a new door can open in your life, where happiness will be the only experience.",
        "card_description": "The circle drawn in this card is a moving wheel, which symbolizes the cycle of time, the cycle of fate or the cycle of karma. The nebulae are moving circularly around the circle. Pictures of twelve zodiac signs are visible inside the perimeter. In the inner part of the circle there are eight figures of 'I Ching' and below them, four powers in the four directions are shown in the form of light in the central part within a triangle. The rotating triangle is indicating upward divinity. In the central place of the triangle is the symbol of man and woman, which is shown in the form of creation and acceptance.\n\nIt is often said that if there is one thing in the world that never changes, it is the change in oneself. Change in life is a continuous process. The cycle of human birth, development, death and rebirth is always in motion. Overall adverse circumstances in man's life continue to play their role in his lifestyle. If you look at the outer edge of the circle, you will feel dizzy. If you turn towards the centre within the circle, there is stability, peace in the centre of the storm revolving around you and you will understand so much that you can come out of it.\n\nIf you want to bring changes in your life, you will have to adopt something new. That too not in a fragmentary form, it has to be adopted deeply and completely. Doing this can transform you. You cannot bring anything new into your life, the new enters automatically. All you can do is either accept it or reject it. If you reject it, then understand that you have become just a stone block or have become completely closed or dead. If you accept or embrace it, you have become a flower whose buds are about to open!\n\nThus, when we accept something new in life, life begins from there. That newness is a messenger for you and the life after that is a message. Transformation in life can be achieved only when we hear new, see new and know new. Although to achieve something new in the path of life, a kind of fear of the unknown is felt before accepting it. Instead of being afraid, you should embrace the newness. By doing this, your life will gradually move towards prosperity and one day you will feel transformed.\n",

        "card_content": "There are two words in the English language which are beautiful and meaningful. One of those words is - Break down i.e. to be in a state of collapse, Technically speaking, it would be more appropriate to be in 'neuter gear'. The second word is Break Through, that is, to develop from the state of breakdown and move towards progress, that is, to enter the new world, Where you get a new perspective, new dream and new perspective.\n\nSuch a situation is like delirium in our life. At that time we are not aware of any meditation, At that time all our arguments become irrelevant. After this the process of break through i.e. development begins. In that situation, you enter a new world with a new outlook, new dreams and new perspective.\n\nWhen you ever get into this type of 'nervous breakdown' or delirium, don't panic, Don't worry. Face the challenge posed by such a devastating situation. In that case, do not be afraid that you are becoming a victim of madness! This is not right. In that situation you become heart oriented, Become self-centred, so that you can find a new path of progress to face the present challenge. In case of brain breakdown, you should slowly turn towards the conscience, from where the door of a new opportunity will open for you. - In such a situation, breakdown can convert into breakthrough.\n\nBy the time you reach a state of breakdown, the structure of thoughts inside your brain has been shattered. You lose control over it. At such a moment, that level of the brain becomes completely independent. Modern psychology indicates several disciplines in this subject, With the help of which you can come back to normal condition. In case of a breakdown your previous brain (previous collection of thoughts) has disappeared. In such a situation, a state of emptiness is created in your mind between the previous and next thoughts. From here the person is oriented towards the heart.\n\nThere are two levels of energy within us. The first level is very light or thin. In this first layer of energy we perform routine day-to-day tasks. Like getting up from bed in the morning, taking breakfast after bathing etc., going to office or job, earning money and coming back home etc. there are various types of tasks.\n\nWhen we are in a state of meditation, we get strength from the energy of the first layer within us. This is a new type of work, Because at that time the brain continues to work on its old pattern, New energy is not available. In such a situation, if you want to do anything at that moment, you will feel frustrated and tired. From there the breakthrough (development) starts within you. This is the second layer of energy in the brain, which has so much energy that you will never feel tired.\n\nThe brain is a storehouse of contradictory thoughts. Different types of thoughts, Thinking, the complexities of thousands of thoughts keep fighting with each other, keeps making noise, And they keep on distracting your attention by colliding with each other, Dispels your drowsiness. Thousands of thoughts keep dragging you towards each other in a single moment. Even in such circumstances, it is a miracle that they all get along! Every thought in your mind wants to pull you towards you, fighting with you. In such a situation you fall into terrible confusion, This has been called the brain or mind. Where the functioning of the brain gets blocked and becomes in a state of breakdown. That is, it becomes like a dead person.\n\nOne thing is worth noting here. There is no guarantee that every 'breakdown' will turn into a 'breakthrough'. Yes, it is certainly important that 'breakdown' can be 'breakthrough', If that moment is used properly, then...!\n",

It seems as if there is a web of filaments extending from the solar system, or that figure is a centre of energy and power, whose posture is emanating abundance of joy and determination.\n\nWe generally sometimes reach such a point, where the thought spontaneously arises that 'enough... enough... is enough...! At that moment it seems to us that we should do something, anything…' whereas it is a different matter if that thought of ours later reaches such a level that there could be a mistake in doing so, There may be a mistake, In such a situation, throw away whatever burden, obstacles and hindrances there are on the mind. These forces keep you confined within a circle. If you do not do this, your life will be filled with unrest, failure and complex problems.\n\nYou should abandon the ancient way of life and old beliefs and move forward on the new path of life with new zeal and enthusiasm. Fill your new life with happiness through this breakthrough.\n\nWhenever you drive a car, you have to change its gear. When you change gears, there comes a moment when that gear becomes neutral for some time. Now he has to roam around in the same situation. Neutral gear means no gear. Shifting from one gear to another. In the same way, a neutral state is created in your brain in the process of changing thoughts. From there you gain the courage to accept new challenges and move towards a new path. All possibilities of failure are hidden in every process of progress. When success has germinated in your heart. Therefore, the path of your progress is bright.\n",

Spirituality flows within you automatically. Its origin is natural. When you get a new vision and a new perspective on life, understand that it is a new beginning in your life. There is a new way to maintain one's own existence. Whatever you have achieved so far in your life, you will have to leave the old to adopt a new path with a new vision. Now it has become your past. Therefore, do not carry the burden of the past on your shoulders any more, Because now he has become an unnecessary burden for you.\n\nLife is to live your present. Sad memories of the past will poison your present, which is not possible for you to digest. Therefore, come out of the web of past and future and make yourself present in the present. The realisation of the present is the realisation of God. God is not a person whom you have to go to meet at some point. God is an experience, Your sense of disintegration and termination, The feeling of your ego vanishing! When your ego becomes zero, then what else is left? The endless 'void' of mere existence, which is completely without disorder and pure. Here 'zero' does not mean negativity. This 'void' is filled with fullness.\n\nYour old vision and old system are dead, In its place a new vision and new imagination have been born. The brain is an illusion. The brain is a museum of thousands of different contradictory thoughts, where contradictory thoughts remain entangled among themselves in noise, commotion and conflict. In such a situation, you become confused and confused, you do not know which direction to go? Somehow you try to remain calm, but the turmoil of thoughts continues inside you, This is what you call 'brain' or 'mind'.\n\nIf you are aware that the mind is an illusion and that you have no identity or identity with that mind, then you can never fail, never deviate from the path. In such a situation your brain will become inactive and weak. In other words it becomes moribund, As a result, you are born again without a brain. The light of divine joy fills you. New birth, new vision and new perspective establish you in the kingdom of peace or heaven. The new vision will immerse you in the ocean of bliss otherwise you will feel yourself falling into hell. Suppose you fall into hell like this? In such a situation, with a new vision, a new imagination and a new perspective, if you take a strong determination to get out of that trap, then you will be able to make yourself feel like you are in heaven.\n",

        "card_content": "Without death there is no existence of life. Then why fear death? Death creates a situation where life merges with existence. This is a great insight that there is a clear difference in death.\n\nThink of it as a background or blackboard, Where life is written with white chalk. Death is like the deep darkness of night, in which the beginning of life is like the twinkling stars. If you destroy darkness, end it, then those twinkling stars become invisible. This is what happens during the day. The stars twinkling in the darkness of night do not go anywhere during the day, they remain there, But in the intense light of the sun we are not able to see the stars in the sky. They can be seen only after their difference becomes clear.\n\nThe possibility of a saint exists because of a sinner, that is, a saint does not exist without a sinner. Any object has two aspects, positive and negative. Our perspective of looking at them may differ. If we accept it, the thing can be transformed. Therefore, transformation is possible only in the accepting state.\n\nYou will have to become your own witness to transform the unbearable journey of your life. There are three important steps to transformation, but for that you need to (1) Do not resist evil. (2) Know that your opponents are not actually opponents, but are worthy of your complement or compliment, They are indispensable to you. Hence they are without options. (3) You become your own witness. Because if you become a witness to the sufferings and disasters you have suffered, you will be able to relate to yourself.\n\nWhen you become a witness to your own struggles, sufferings and failures, you will notice a huge difference. But with that evidence you will be able to convert inferior or inferior metal into gold. With the help of that evidence you can become a scientist of your conscience. As a result of that evidence, you can transform your inner feelings. But this requires indomitable courage. People who stick to old traditions, rotten beliefs and convenient approach in their life, They may not be able to make any kind of transformation. Only those who have the courage to break away from life's inconsistencies, disparities, reason, apprehensions and all the bondages of the mind and enter into a limitless existence, are successful in transformation.\n\nMost people think that the path on which they are living their lives is bright and joyful? If their answer is 'No', then they will definitely have to take the risk of rethinking their way of life and transforming the old path. For that, a new path, new lifestyle and new research will have to be adopted. Remember one thing here that you have nothing to lose in such a change. Till now you have not achieved any success, happiness and inner peace from your old lifestyle. The old way of life has become meaningless for you. A new path, new lifestyle and new efforts can be meaningful in your life. For this you will have to have extraordinary courage and indomitable willpower. People who are infatuated with the old and are leading heavy lives, take the help of 'Philosophy' to make their meaningless things meaningful. They do not have the courage to break the old dilapidated system and come out. While others bring about a complete change in their life through transformation, and through the new way of life, they achieve everything which they could not achieve from their past.\n",
        "card_description": "The figure in the centre of the card is sitting on a huge flower, where there is complete 'void space'. He is holding the symbols of transformation in his hands. The sword visible in one of his hands dispels the illusion, A snake held in one hand is a symbol of change in life, that is, the snake sheds its old skin and becomes a new one. The broken chain of limitations means breaking all the bonds and coming out. He has kept one of his hands open in his lap, which is a symbol of openness and acceptability. The other hand is touching the face of a figure sleeping just below, Which is a symbol of silent peace.\n\nThis is the time when you can dig deep and reflect on your past lifestyle. By accepting the problems like sorrow, grief, obstacles etc. that come in your life, understand their reality. Make a new version of them.\n\nThe process of transformation is also like death. The time of transformation, like death, is its own time, Because it takes you from one dimension to another. This form of yours is external. Therefore, the process of transformation starts from the external form. If you muster indomitable courage, inner transformation can also take place.\n\nConversion is an authorised and authentic miracle. It transforms you in the same way as raw metal transforms into gold. Hope plays the most important role in this. By searching for your reasons, not with your intellectual mind but with your loving heart, the language can be understood even just by listening, without worrying about lies.\n\nYou can transform the most difficult journey of your life, the witness of which you will have to find yourself. As a result of that witnessing, you can transform your inner feelings. Those people who are living a heavy life due to old or dilapidated attachment, their only fault is that they are not able to break that system and come out. This is proof of his lack of courage.\n",

        "card_content": "There are mutually contradictory elements present within humans. Contradictory thoughts unless analyzed within, Unless there is complete certainty about them, they cannot be explained anywhere else. Therefore the contradiction should be eliminated within. Politics is a situation within you. It has its presence between two parts of the mind. The bridge built between you and existence is very short. If that bridge collapses due to some accident, whether due to some sabotage, or some psychological reason, whatever the reason may be, As soon as this happens, the person gets divided into two parts and he becomes two 'individuals' inside.\n\nTherefore, a person should eliminate the 'two personalities' or contradictions created within him, Integrate them. His existence is always alive, Otherwise you would not exist. Take a bullock cart for example. The bullock cart is moving, moving forward. His wheel is moving, rotating, Because its center is stable. The wheel rotates on its axis (Hub). In the same way your life is also revolving around the center point of existence, Is dynamic.\n\nYou have to create insight to know and see the center of the life cycle within you. Insight means looking within yourself. Keep your eyes open outwards. Keep your hands extended outwards. Keep the legs moving away from yourself. Sit quietly. Experience peace within the periphery, In the next process, close your eyes and immediately go inward. At that time there should not be any disorder, any thinking or any kind of excitement in your mind. If you allow this process to happen normally, you will reach deeper into the inner plane. You will feel as if you have broken through the clouds and reached the shining center!\n\nThis is a beautiful meditation. You can try this several times during the twenty-four hours of the day and night. Stop suddenly for half a second, So you will feel that the circumference of the world is constantly moving, but you are not there. When you become very conscious of the fact that the world will continue to function without you, you will be able to interpret the other part of the personality within you, Which has been neglected for a long time. You reach deep inside the mind. The deeper you sink, the more you will gain. Because your integration is done. Now instead of two contradictions, two personalities within you, there is only one... only you.\n",

Night is opposed to day, Light, the opponent of darkness, Love is the opposite of hate... similarly other contradictions keep the mind divided into two parts. Through integration, both contradictory variables become one. The process of integration occurs continuously, Because the center of both contradictions is the same, Both originate from the same seed.\n\nBoth Garuda and Hans have the power to fly. Garuda is the form of strength and loneliness, the form of silence. The swan floats and dives in the vast unlimited space in the form of purity and pure emotions. His inner self is complete and satisfied. We integrate the swan and the eagle within us, Let's form a pair. The integration card of contradictory variables like man, woman, fire-water, life-death etc. is a symbol of self-creation. It is a symbol of new life, but it is mysterious. Yet unification is still considered a miracle.",

The people of the society impose different types of thoughts in your mind, People should start civilizing you, Before that, you should know your real nature and your conclusion.\n\nYour external personality, created by various factors of society, is not your own. Unless you throw off the cloak of your personality, Till then you cannot recognize your true nature, Can't feel my self-respect. Self-respect is a guarantee of existence, Whereas personality is the gift of society, It is a facility provided by society. The identity of your personality given by society is masking your real identity. In this regard, see an example of a beautiful moral story -\n\nA pregnant lioness was crossing the road jumping on the high mountain ridges. During that time she gave birth to a child. The child fell into the herd of sheep grazing below. The sheep took care of the lioness's cub and raised it, but they did not know that it was the cub of the lion, the sheep's enemy. Even the lion did not know that he was a lion's child, Because there was a herd of sheep around him. Therefore, that lion also lives in the company of sheep and walks like a sheep, eats, drinks, runs and even speaks in the same way...! The lion cub never knew that he was a lion! The reason for this was that from birth till he grew up, he lived in a herd of sheep. That's why his eating, drinking, walking, running, speaking etc. all became like sheep.\n\nThe lion, the king of the jungle, always roams alone. Lions never live in groups. With one of his roars, the entire surrounding area, animals and creatures etc. tremble. But in that lion living with sheep, everything except its physical structure was similar to that of sheep. Gradually he had grown up, but he did not know that he was a lion.\nOne day when an old lion saw that scene, he could not believe his eyes! Till now in his life, he had never seen a lion roaming around like a sheep in a herd of sheep. There was no possibility of friendship between the two. The old lion could not believe his eyes at all. He suddenly ran towards the sheep and all the sheep started running away screaming. The young lion also screamed in the same manner and started running away in fear. With great difficulty the old lion managed to catch the young lion, But the young lion kept crying, screaming and trembling like a sheep.\n\nThe old lion dragged the young lion to a pond. The young lion was so powerful that if he had known that he was a lion, the old lion would not have been able to even touch him! But he had become a sheep. That's why he was scared, he was trembling.\n\nA miracle happened on the pond. The old lion encouraged the young lion to look inside the well. While peeping into the pond, their images were visible in the water. The young lion was actually transformed into a lion upon seeing his own reflection, Because in reality it was not a sheep! His personality was like that of a sheep, his external personality was formed in the society of sheep. When the young lion saw his form for the first time, a roar came from within him, which echoed in the surrounding hills. The lion found his real identity, who he really is?\n\nExternal factors play important roles in the structure of your personality. Society, civilization, education, etc. have a special role in building your personality. What this means is that your personality is given to you by others. Look at a four-five year old child, Whose personality has not yet developed. Now that will take a long time. Therefore, at this time that four-five year old child is his own personality, that is his identity. He has not yet been influenced by external thoughts, to understand this you should turn back to your past. Reach there, when you would have been a small child of about three to four years. At this time, try to feel like a three-four year old child, but you will not remember anything. From then till now a long gap of time has formed. You will not remember anything because you had no personality at that time. When you were born on this earth, you had no name. You received education, studied and attained a certain qualification. When you were born, you were neither an engineer, nor a doctor, nor a professor. All these abilities kept getting added to you. Your name, degree, your fame... etc. characteristics became associated with you and became the identity of your personality. In that personality you were buried under many layers. If your personality created by external factors is taken out, you will be left as a completely 'zero', blank slate. That is your real identity. Your real personality is what you feel is best. Quite apart from your external personality, you are not what you learned from others, That is your personality. You have to regain your disorder-free, innocent form. Which is your real identity.\n",
        "card_description": "This card retells an ancient folk tale. In which there is an interesting story of the transformation of a lion. As soon as the cub is born from the womb of a lioness, the cub falls down from the hills into the herd of sheep. After this, its overall upbringing, care, speaking, grazing etc. became like that of a sheep and the lion cub considered itself a sheep. After being captured by the old lion, the young lion came to know his true identity. The old lion caught him and took him to the bank of a pond and after seeing his reflection in the water of the pond, the young lion realized that he was not a sheep but a lion, the king of the jungle. There are many such people among us in the society, Like that young lion, people consider the cover of their external personality to be their real identity. Considering the personality imposed by outsiders as our real identity, we too live in a herd like sheep and consider ourselves sheep, Unable to move freely, completely unaware of our own identity. But, this is the time to know your own reality! To recognize your real face in the mirror of your conscience!",

They don't want to remember him, Because by remembering they fear that their ego will be shattered. And if this happens, it is possible that they may be hit by a thunderbolt. The more we achieve in this life, the more we desire to give it up and forget them. If a small glimpse of truth comes into your vision, your mentality will get confused. There will be excitement in the brain. You will become confused and unable to understand anything.\n\nSometimes it also happens that when you are in deep sleep, something happens that suddenly wakes you up. It is generally seen that when we come out of deep sleep, we gradually come into a state of complete wakefulness. First of all we give up deep sleep, After this the dreams gradually disappear while floating, The existence of dreams lasts only for a few moments. But on the contrary, sometimes it also happens that suddenly something happens that, like an arrow, we come out of deep sleep and come straight into the waking state. In that situation your eyes remain open and you keep wondering, 'Where am I?' 'Who am I?' Nothing becomes clear for a moment, You lose all your identity. At such a moment you feel as if you have arrived in a different world! But keep in mind that it feels like this only for a moment. The very next moment you return to normal state again.\n\nThis is not a big shock. This happens every day in our lives. You wake up every morning. At that time you return from the dream world to the waking world. This is your normal routine, But sometimes when this process happens suddenly, you are shocked, Become frightened. When you are truly awake, you become completely speechless. At that time you are not aware of what has happened. At that time everything becomes calm and silent. Only those who make sacrifices attain the true joy of life, Some stay away from accepting. The more a man achieves in this world, in this life, the more he moves forward with the desire to give up and achieve more. This is a contradiction. Even all the laws of life are full of contradictions.\n\nYou cannot limit anything in your life. The more tightly you try to hold any object, the more easily that object will slip from your hand. An open hand is never empty, And a closed fist is always empty. Holding on to anything in life is sheer foolishness. The biggest mistake is to hold on to something. By doing this the person loses everything that he was going to get.\n",

The figure seen in it is in a state of meditation, which appears to be experiencing its own consciousness. You may also be feeling unsteady and somewhat disoriented from the explosion, As if the earth is shaking beneath your feet! It seems as if the spontaneity and health of your conscious state has been challenged. If you want, you can gain an important experience of your life from the same destroyed debris. It is an eternal truth of creation that negative approach is an indicator of positivity, Destruction is the beginning of new construction.",

        "card_content": "When you focus within yourself, you are touched by a new and wonderful silence, Where there is only silence. It is not silence or absence of noise. This silence is completely visible and tactile.\n\nOuter peace cannot be compared to inner peace. If a person goes into a forest, If he goes to the mountains and caves, he will definitely experience a kind of silence or peace, But it is actually a negative peace. One experiences peace there because there is no noise of the market, There is no traffic noise there. Not the roar of a flying airplane, There is no noise of barking dogs and crowd of humans. That's why there is silence, Because there is absence of noise, But that is not real peace, There is a negative silence.\n\nYou are nothing alone. The entire existence has complete dominance over you. The total force of existence has complete authority over you. In such a moment when silence penetrates inside you, at that moment you understand its power. It happens suddenly. Gautam Buddha had a similar experience, Which he called 'zero'. In other words, such power or silence can be called 'silence'. Which is spread in the depth of your conscience. You can experience real peace or total silence only when you move your attention away from the explosive hustle and bustle of the external environment and focus it deep within your inner self. Such peace and such silence is present within you.\n\nThere are very few of us who actually like peace or silence. Although many people say that they like to live in peace or quiet. But when the moment comes to remain quiet or silent, they do not like to remain silent or still. They immediately turn towards some play or entertainment. Some activity or the other starts. They become frightened by the atmosphere of silence. The more silent you remain, the more invisible your existence becomes. As long as your mind is in control of you, you are the embodiment of noise. The centre point of noise and commotion is your ego. There are moments when your mind becomes invisible, when your mind is in a state of 'nothingness' amidst this terrible noise and destruction, So instead of noise, a strange silence prevails. At that time both your mind and your ego disappear like steam.\n\nIf a person loves peace or silence, it is certain that he loves the entire existence. Love of existence will be called love of the purest form of religion. Unless there is silence deep within your conscience, you cannot assess things correctly. To love the whole existence is the real 'Sanyasa'!",

In such a meditative state, the night goddess communicates deep peace and wonderful knowledge. This time is precious for you. You can relax within yourself. You measure the peace deep within your soul, where the silence of the entire universe meets.\n\nNow you have nothing left to do. Don't go anywhere else. The peace within you allows you to do anything. The silence of your conscience may cause discomfort to some people, Which has become a unit of noise of the outside world. Identify the forces that disturb your solitude or your peace, locate them and remove them from yourself.\n",

In the cycle of life and death one easily becomes a victim of forgetfulness and then suddenly one gets a new womb and then one forgets one's previous body, but this process is interrupted at intervals, by darkness and unconsciousness, Keep disrupting the continuous process. The cycle of life and death continues in the same way as one dream comes, another dream follows it. A pilgrim starts his journey at one moment and then enters another moment. Similarly, one moment after another, then the next moment keeps passing, but the pilgrim's steps keep moving forward. Similarly, after birth, there is death, then birth… then death, the body leaves and is regained. But the soul continues on its journey...!\n\nTo understand the process of reincarnation or past lives along with this birth, try to understand some of the things that happen in daily life. When you go to bed at night and sleep takes you completely, So at that time in your conscious state concentrate on that thought, Which is still present in your brain before sleeping. Now you go to sleep with the same thought in your mind. When you wake up in the morning and are ready to get out of bed, look back and see that the last thought of color, with which you went to sleep, becomes your first thought this morning. You may be extremely surprised by this result. Well, in the same way, the last wish that is permanent in your mind at the time of death becomes your first wish at the time of rebirth. When you die, your body disintegrates, but your brain continues on its journey. The age of your body, maybe 50 years, But your brain or your soul may be five million years old. The souls held by the body in every birth are united in this birth of yours.\n\nJust as there is a storehouse of goods in a warehouse, in the same way your brain is also a storehouse of memories of your previous lives, So your brain is very old. It is not just a repository of memories of human birth, Rather, the memories of all your previous births are present in your mind in the present human birth.",

Let us understand the different dimensions of our life's actions, Try to know what types they are. Their roots have reached that depth where the endless cycle of unconsciousness continues. The two rainbow lizards in the picture are symbols of knowing and not knowing something. She is the guardian of unconsciousness. She is making sure that we are ready for a scene, otherwise everything can go to pieces. A glimpse into the core of existence is a gift to us. The responsibility of our actions is not such in our lives that we can get caught in our clutches. This is the call of the conscious state.

Here 'knowledge' or information means your name, identity and the overall information that you have received from others. In the name of knowledge you have to become 'zero' or 'blank paper'. You have to become brainless once again. In the same way, like a child who has playful eyes and stammering words.\n\nYour basic nature is innocent and guileless, You don't have to be innocent. You are innocent and innocent by birth. From the time you are born till the age of three-four years, your innocence is gradually covered with external knowledge, layer by layer. The name given by the society and layers of different types of knowledge accumulated on your innocence and all this became your identity and your personality. Your innocence and your sincerity are like a mirror, In which the images keep coming and going, but the mirror remains the same. The mirror doesn't have to be found anywhere, He is not even lost. It is hidden in layers of outer dust.\n\nThe process of you being innocent and innocent is not the process in which something is created. That process is the process of exploring your existence. You don't have to get anything new from outside. You are already that.\n\nAlthough you work hard to regain your innocence, it does not come out. That's why you forget everything. Your innocence and sincerity have been covered with the outer cover of knowledge and identity in such a way that you are forced to forget it. Society is full of cunningness. For centuries man has been taught that you can survive in society only when you become immersed in the cunningness of the society.\n\nThe more cunning and cunning you are, the more successful you will be. The only politics prevalent in all these is how to become smarter than others! Don't live your life on information and advice borrowed from others. Try to find your own intelligence. Throw off the cloak of knowledge given by society, which you have been wearing for a long time and which has become your identity.\n\nSo you become just like a normal child. You once again become like a newborn baby, who has just been born in this world.

They are expressing a reaction to your presence. The childlike innocence within a human being is achieved only after deep experience of life, but it is not like that of a child. There is beauty in the innocence of children, who are innocent and ignorant. When the same child grows up, layers of knowledge are imposed on his innocence by a deceitful society.

        "card_content": "Wrapped in the veil of illusion and illusion, we lose our real identity. To get out of confusion we have to be a little alert, Because knowingly or unknowingly we keep chasing dreams in the world of illusion. In the same dreamland we pile up our hopes.\n\nOur mind or brain survives in the world of illusion. What we call mind or brain is nothing but all those misconceptions which you have stored in your brain, It is piled up. These illusions are of different types, like illusion of memories, illusion of imagination, illusion of dreams, illusion of hopes and desires. At the root of all these misconceptions is a great illusion – the ego of 'I am'. All kinds of misconceptions revolve around this. Between these two your reality gets destroyed.\n\nMeditation simply means coming out of the confusing circle of dreams, aspirations, imaginations and past and future, which are wrapped around you like a blanket. At such a moment, completely coming out of these illusory factors and not having any thoughts in your mind at that time is your real identity, That is your reality. To overcome misconceptions, you should set immediate goals, Because you have been carrying these misconceptions in your life for a long time. In other words, it has become your habit to live a life of illusion or illusion. The hopes of your life are alive in those illusions. We are alive with the help of those hopes. To give up on them means to give up on the future, Abandon all hope! How can we carry our present without hope?\n\nLiving your present without any hope or expectation is an art, but remember one thing here that living a life without hope does not mean living a life with despair. The general meaning of a life without hope is: The present is so beautiful that who should worry about the future! Who can bear the imaginary burden of the future in the present? One is the person whose present is empty and full of despair, But there is one whose present is so beautiful and perfect that he has no space to think about the future.\n\nThe person who lives a life full of disappointments, his life remains empty. He doesn't know what the present is? The future of such a person becomes invisible. There are millions and crores of such people in the world, who get crushed between the stones of past and future and ultimately become the grip of death. Living a life without hope or expectations means living in the present. Always think that there is no tomorrow. Whatever we see, whatever appears before us, is the present. If you adopt such an approach in your life, then understand that a new life has been infused within you.\n\nOften we think only about the past and the future, because our present remains completely empty. We don't know at all how to live those moments! The result is that, either we live the past in the present which no longer matters, The future has no meaning in the present. The moments between the two are everything in life.\n\nThe correct meaning of ILLUSION in the English language cannot be illusion or confusion. Where there is confusion, we mistakenly consider one thing to be another thing. Whereas it is not so here. In the dark of night, we jump thinking that a piece of rope lying on the road is a snake, but immediately the illusion breaks and we come out of the illusion. But after slipping from our present, we keep running towards the past and future under illusion, in which there is the illusion of a beautiful dream coming true and that is Maya. If you throw it away, your beautiful present will be visible in your vision and not the emptiness of past and future.\n",

From whom we expect great expectations, hopes and dreams to come true! In the card, an aura of consciousness or alertness is spread on the background of the butterfly, and the directly visible figure is eternally meditating towards its inner self. The space between his two eyes is open. Which reveals spiritual secrets and at the same time makes one feel the rising sun of awareness. Meditation emerges in the inner part only with the rising sun.\n\nThe card reminds us to look within ourselves instead of wandering in the external world to recognize reality. When we look towards our outer shell, often we too are not able to take the right decision amidst the confusion of true and false, good and bad, love-hate, hope-disappointment, etc. Therefore, if you look at all these misconceptions, then when you return to the depths of your soul, you will clearly understand the difference between dreams and reality.\n\nGenerally people think mostly about the past and future. Whereas past and future do not exist. The result is that we destroy our present by thinking about the invisible consequences of the past and future. If we start living between past and future then life can be happy. There is often a fear of snakes after seeing a rope lying on the road in the dark of night. This is our illusion. When we realize the truth, our illusions are shattered. Living a life without hope or expectation means living in the present.\n\nWhatever we see, whatever appears in front of us and whatever is present around us is our present. The past cannot be brought into the present, Whereas what is going to happen in the future is all invisible. Therefore, we should break the illusion of past and future and always live in the present.\n",

Remain attached to a thing which is incomplete, because it waits for its completion.\n\nIn fact, the entire existence constantly longs for perfection. Anything in the world expects perfection. The answer given by you on any topic is incomplete.\n\nDo you remember when you have completed something? Have you ever had or experienced any such moment in your life? Which can you call complete overall? If you have such an experience of fullness, understand that your mind will never go back to it, There is no need for it, now it has become useless. The brain always tries to make everything complete, completely perfect. It is also necessary, Otherwise life will become impossible.\n\nEvery person in this world has taken a wrong path of living, which is actually an incomplete life. Nothing ends and you set out to make a new beginning. All those incomplete things or entanglements of incompleteness come together and become a heavy burden on the brain. They are never complete, but become a permanent burden on the mind.\n\nIf you really want to avoid this irony, be holistic in everything you do. Don't start anything new until you have finished what is just beginning. If you are taking a bath, then enjoy the bath in the falling water and get completely satisfied with the bath, only then come out. If you leave something incomplete, that incompleteness will keep following you like a reflection.\n\nWhatever you are doing, perfect it. There is no hurry in the work, do it with complete patience so that the brain gets saturated, leave it only when you are satisfied. If you are angry, be completely angry, if you try to laugh in anger, then that is your incompleteness, incompleteness of life.\n\nYou are angry, but smiling! In such a situation, anger will not leave you. You may deceive the world, but your inner self knows very well that the smile spread on your face when you are angry is false! At that time your anger remains present inside. So don't live your life wrongly, Wrong life means incomplete life. Live every moment of life as if there is no other moment for you. Only if we adopt such an approach in life will we be able to achieve perfection.",

In this way He creates a field of power which illuminates the entire universe with His wonderful soul. If you find such a Guru, he will be a wonderful boon for you.

Do you think that existence is poor? Look at millions of flowers, enjoy their fragrance. Look at the billions and billions of stars, Can you count them? You can see at most three thousand stars with your naked eyes, which is nothing in proportion to the number of stars. Those stars are spreading, Are expanding openly.

A fulfilling and prosperous life does not mean that there is a pile of money and wealth.\n\nProsperous and complete life means making life more and more pleasant, more comfortable and full of love and affection, making life more and more acceptable. You have to be perfect, that is, you have to become rich in body, rich in science, rich in meditation, complete consciousness.

Dancing with the same joy, they welcome spring with their flowers and fragrance. 'Orange' is considered the color of spring in most countries of Asia including India.\n\nIf you ever pass through forests and gardens in spring, you will see that all the trees and colorful flowers growing on the vines will paint your inner self with spring colors with their beauty and variety of colors. The entire forest gets covered with flowers in such a way that even the leaves of the trees are not visible.\n\nThis is the process of filling your inner soul with the happiness of supreme bliss and making the flower of divine bliss bloom. Flowers of consciousness bloom to make your inner self happy.

If you are taking a walk in the morning, take a slow walk while blissfully enjoying nature, no hurry, If you are eating, chew slowly and enjoy the food. If you are talking, speak slowly and comfortably, No rush. When you sit under a tree after a long walk, and the cool morning breeze blows, it fills you with freshness. Whatever you are doing, be completely calm and at ease within yourself. In today's stressful world everyone is in a hurry, There is a hurry. Everyone is in a hurry, But don't know the reason! The one who has nowhere to go is also in a hurry. No one cares why and where you are going? Not just going, We are also increasing our speed. I don't know what your goal is or how far you reach!\n\nTherefore, keep all your processes slow. By slowing down even your mundane activities, you will experience incredible peace. Chew while eating and eat peacefully. Similarly, keep each of your normal processes slow. If you take twenty minutes to eat food, why not forty minutes? If you taste the dishes comfortably and chew them thoroughly, then the digestion process will also be easy. Sometimes such an occasion comes when you have nothing to do. At that time you do not do anything, Just sit quietly and peacefully. Even at that time you could read 'newspaper' or TV. Don't even look. By doing this you protect yourself from unnecessary interference. Sometimes when you have nothing to do, You are completely free and quiet, so you should feel happy that you have free time. Sit quietly, look at the stars, constellations and trees and plants on earth, Close your eyes and look into your inner self.\n\nhappiness and sorrow, peace and unrest, Satisfaction and dissatisfaction, These are all options of the mind. Leave negativity and always have a positive approach, All your problems will be solved automatically. If you can sit peacefully for at least an hour every day and continue this process for about three to four months, Then for the first time in your life you will be able to understand what real peace is! Unless a person knows what real peace is, he cannot even know what life is. When a light touch of peace touches your inner being, all the flowers in your consciousness blossom and become fragrant and then you experience the real feeling of life but, not in a hurry, Not with panic and anxiety, By staying slow!",
        "card_description": "The rainbow leader depicted in this card reminds us that like this turtle, we carry our home with us wherever we go. There is no need to rush, no need to seek shelter elsewhere. The deeper we go into the ocean of emotions, the more satisfied, self-centred and free we feel. Having high expectations from someone becomes a cause of sadness and worry. At such times, give up all expectations, Along with that, break and disintegrate the web of illusion that you have woven for yourself. You don't need to do anything at this time, No need to bear any responsibility, Whatever you are, be completely relaxed. It would be best for you if all your wishes, hopes and dreams for the future were put on hold. When the unnecessary burden on your mind is removed, that empty space will be filled with a new kind of determination, confidence and receptivity. Then you will welcome your new growth, You will feel so confident in yourself that you have never felt before! So enjoy every moment of life slowly and comfortably, Embrace this quality and enjoy every moment, every step, being 'at home'. Every moment existence is protecting you.",

Living life is also an adventurous art, But people are so afraid of the unknown that they want to cling to all those relationships, acquaintances and familiar thoughts in their life. They never go beyond the confines of their mind. Such people who live inside their mind, in the periphery of their mind, they live in the grave. If you come out of the periphery of the mind, then understand that you have been truly born, That means you have come out of the grave!\n\nOne can live every moment of one's life with curiosity, Can live with courage. Every moment of it becomes a great gift, Because that moment brings a lot of happiness, It brings a kind of ecstasy. There is someone who is ready to forget his past, but there is also someone who carries a bundle of all the memories of his past on his head, Such a person lives a life like a prison inmate.\n\nA person who is courageous erases every moment of his past, welcomes every coming moment with eagerness and always feels fresh. In this way the life of such a person becomes a courageous life in itself. But all this can be done only by a courageous person, who knows what the truth is! One who is not courageous, who is afraid of the unknown, who wants to live comfortably among loved ones and acquaintances, can never know the truth nor face difficulties.\n\nIf you are in a situation where you don't find new friends every day, enjoy the beauty and goodness of old friends as much as you can, if you are in a situation where friends change every day. If so, that's actually a good thing, Because in such a situation you get the opportunity to make new friends and get the opportunity of pure friendship. Pure friendship, friendship without vices. True friendship has its own beauty.\n\nThe more liveliness there is in life, the more courageous challenges are present. Establishing a friendly relationship with a stranger is full of courageous challenges! To have faith and trust in Him is an even bolder step, It is also a dangerous step. In the same way, disregarding the challenges and dangers, may you face the coming moment with courage, By moving forward in this, you will gain new confidence, new happiness and complete happiness.",

Whenever we step into a new or unknown area, we maintain a child-like approach, child-like confidence and the same innocence and openness. Even if it is a small thing, combined with courage it becomes the greatest thing.",

Therefore, there is no point in thinking about the past and speculating about the future. It is not appropriate to move towards either side unnecessarily. There was one, but now it is not there. The second one is about to happen, which has no beginning. That person lives life properly, who tries to live every moment in the present. His arrows are still on target, but the target is not visible. No matter where a person is, his feeling of being fully awake is present in this very moment.\n\nWherever that person is, his entire consciousness lies with him. The meaning of its existence is related to reality. That is the one true direction, a person who is standing with full consciousness, that is his true direction and only that person can enter through the golden gate.\n\nThe golden gate refers to the present. To live in the present is to pass through the golden gate. If you are not ambitious, then understand that the door of the present is always open for you. Because you have no ambition. You have no desire for power, no desire for wealth and prestige, no desire to attain enlightenment. You don't even have any desire to achieve anything. Therefore there is no ambition to look towards the future, to achieve anything in the future. Only such a person can live in the present.\n\nA person who has to live his present life properly does not need to think of achieving anything. If one tries to live such a life, it gives a new experience. Not an experience which has been thought out in advance! If you hurry, there is a possibility of falling. If you proceed without thinking, you will only fail. Therefore, a person should patiently move forward one step at a time to achieve his goal.",

In this way, while maintaining his balance, he can observe the environment around him. This card challenges us towards the past and future. At the same time he also says that whatever is happening now, let it happen, but there is a need to be careful.\n\nLife is a bottomless ocean. If you lose touch with all your decisions, your important long-term plans, you can get caught up in it. Whatever comes your way and however it comes, you should always be available for it. Don't worry if you stumble a step. Try to stand up by holding yourself automatically. Don't worry if you fall. Instead of worrying, shake off the dust from your clothes, laugh and then take another step forward in the next moment.\n\nLife is an ocean. You can play the game of life in it. If you suspend all your decisions and even give up your preferences, you will always be on your way. Whatever challenges come your way, you will take the right decisions. In such a situation, if you stumble and possibly even fall, you do not need to worry.\n\nAlways learn to live your present in every moment of life. The present is your life, because whatever was to happen in the past has happened, what is going to happen in the future is all invisible. Therefore, every moment of the present is priceless for your life.",

Don't think too hard on your mind, don't interfere with your inner voice.\n\nEvery person is born with his inner self. He cannot be worked with, Because he has become powerless or inactive. Still it can be revived. Don't think too hard, This is the reality. Try this in a particular situation. Although this will be difficult to do, Because due to old habits, you will start thinking with your mind only. If this happens, become alert, become aware. Don't think, Rather feel within yourself what is coming inside your mind! By doing this you will often get confused and confused, Because you will be unable to know whether that thing is coming from your inner self or from your mind? But it is certain that you will soon understand the difference between conscience and mind.\n\nWhenever there is any instruction from the conscience, it comes upwards from your navel. At that time you can feel the hot waves towards the upper part of the navel. Whenever a thought arises in your mind, it comes to the upper surface of the brain and from there it moves downwards. If your mind decides something. At that time you feel something rising inside you like a bubble. Then you press it down with force. Then it reaches deep inside you and goes towards your mind.\n\nNow try to do this in a particular situation. For example, suppose you have lost your way in a forest. Then try to listen to your inner voice. Don't think anything, Close your eyes and sit, put yourself in a meditative state, but do not think. When thinking itself is meaningless, then there is no point in thinking, thinking has become a habit. Where there is nothing left to think about, There man keeps thinking according to his habits.\n\nWhen your brain becomes completely tired and frustrated, you cannot do anything further, So understand that your brain has been 'retired'.

Whatever is presented in this card means that you should have full faith in the guidance you receive from within. The inner voice is like a whisper. Sometimes we hesitate, we are not able to understand that inner voice, Whereas the signal is absolutely clear.

If a rich man becomes generous, know that it is a great transformation, It is a revolutionary event. A rich person can become generous only when he has gained a deep understanding that wealth is useless. Rich people are meaningless to this society. When that person here realizes that all the things that this world can give are meaningless, They are valueless, at that time the only thing left is generosity, which we should share.\n\nMan's greatest wealth is his generosity. This is a wealth which does not diminish when distributed. Generosity exists only where there is poverty. No poor man says that he is not generous and no rich man is generous to anyone spontaneously. It doesn't matter to us if we share whatever we have, because we are not stingy. To become rich, it is not necessary to have a huge bank balance, all types of movable and immovable capital. The person who keeps collecting things is called miser. Whatever we collect, we cannot take it with us from here. Therefore, it would be better if we do not be stingy in distributing whatever we have stored in our mind. This is generosity.\n\nIf you don't have such an approach, you will develop an instinct to acquire more and more, to accumulate more and more. There is no end to this longing. If you do not become alert, careful, then all the prosperity and splendour of this world will be reduced, Because the mind cannot bear the weight of what you have. The mind is never satisfied with material things. He keeps missing something and wants more. The meaning is that the mind is never satisfied.\n\nThe nature of the mind is that it wants more. The desires of a rich man are never satisfied by the wealth available to him, He wants more.\n\nThe conclusion is that generosity is real wealth. The sign of generosity is to share whatever you have. There is no need to acquire or accumulate more. For generosity it is not necessary that you possess Kuber's treasure and keep distributing it.\n\nYou have nothing, Your situation has become like that of a beggar. You have become just a road sign, Still, you can be generous.\n\nHow can the distance between your inner consciousness and the physical pressure on your mind be reduced, For this, study your activities in daily life. Only then can you feel the guidance or signal of your inner consciousness, When your mind is satisfied with your present.\n\nDo you smile when you see a stranger passing by you? You can smile and both of you can exchange your feelings, and when you do that, you are generous. If someone is sad, can you sing a song? You can be generous at that time. It doesn't cost you anything to smile and sing songs!\n\nRegarding money, you too can become a very rich person, But in real sense you will remain poor, Because you would not like to share anything with anyone. Even your wife, children, relatives, friends etc. will become strangers to you. A miser or a greedy person keeps himself enclosed in a circle from all sides, in which there is no door to meet him. The life of such an insignificant person is like that of a dead body lying in a grave. His conscience is suppressed.\n\nThe question here is not that you should share something! Here the question is about general exchange, which is related to our inner consciousness. You have nothing, But you have a big heart. You make someone laugh by smiling, singing, dancing or laughing. Simply, this generosity is your greatest wealth.\n",

With all this he has made himself ugly. His goal is distorted and selfish.\n\nThis card challenges us to ask whether there is a need for any kind of siege or fortification around the things that we are trapped in and that are present within us, that we consider extremely valuable? It is not necessary that diamonds be a box full of jewels or a huge amount of money, It could be anything. Generally we spend time with ourselves or try to express our inner love to someone. If you have kept it locked within yourself, Then it will be like a well, which has been completely closed from the top by placing a lid on it. Due to non-use of water from such a well, it smells foul.\n\nWhatever you have, don't hold on to it, Leave open, Share with others, No one goes from here, Everything is left here!",

This entire world is related to existence, It is a part of existence. To be connected to the whole is to be connected to existence, Only then can you be a part of existence, not otherwise. The trees-plants, animals-birds, rivers-mountains, sun-moon, stars etc. of this universe will remain as strangers. Unless you make a divine connection! Where you connect with them, your entire life will be transformed.\n\nThis world itself is a pilgrimage, a pilgrimage of great purpose or glory, But to be associated with a particular place, to be a part of a place, You cannot be said to be related to the whole. To regain what you have lost, you have to move inwards. Sometimes you stand in the market, but you are not in the market yourself, Even while standing in a crowd, you remain lonely, that is, you remain an 'outsider'. As long as you remain an 'outsider', Till then you will not be able to connect with existence. Until you cease to be a part of existence, Till then you will keep wasting your precious life by carrying the burden of loneliness, outsider Ness and unfamiliarity. To be a part of the total existence you have to go within yourself. Unless you are a part of this universe, you will not be able to realize your inner power. As long as you remain an 'outsider', Until then you will not be able to free yourself from the feeling of being alone, a stranger and an outsider.

Celebrate at your pure leisure, You will sing, a sweet song will emerge from within you, That song will be a song of your awareness, your alertness.

There we try to compromise. Compromising is equivalent to denying the truth. When we compromise, we get stuck in uncertain and wrong situations.\n\nIf we think seriously, we will realize that generally we keep trying to achieve something or the other. In an effort to achieve something, sometimes we differ on some issues. In such a situation we need the support of others. Where alternatives are sought after seeking support, some compromise has to be made and the result obtained from the compromise is often bitter.\n\nNo religion can accept you completely. Some things are ignored, some have to be fought for, some have to be destroyed. Is not completely accepted. Their reasoning for not accepting you completely is, 'We accept your love, Not your hatred! Throw out your hatred, Destroy it and that's a big problem, Because the moment you completely destroy hatred, love is also destroyed. Love and hate are not two, they are one. They say - 'We accept your silence, but not your anger'. Destroy your anger. Your vitality will automatically be destroyed. You will not be alive, you will be nothing more than a living corpse. Silence is not life, it is a kind of death!\n\nReligion divides you into two parts: divine or holy, divine and demonic, sinful! - If the evil or monstrosity within you is destroyed, then divinity will automatically be destroyed. They accept divinity or purity, but reject evil or demon city. If a person follows them he will realize that the moment a person destroys the demon within him, the god within him is automatically destroyed.\n\nNo one actually follows his teachings, Because their preaching is useless. Then what do people do there? The answer is clear, people cheat! This is how everyone is deceiving you, Confusing! And all these religions have created a similar ostentation. If you accept that ostentation, then you have also become ostentation! Now you are following them, then understand that you are dead, only their pomp is alive in your body. If you don't listen to them, you feel an invisible, unconscious feeling of guilt.\n\nWhat will you do now? If you follow them, you will become dead even though you are alive. If you don't follow them, you will always suffer from guilt, What will you do in such a situation? In such a situation, cunning minded people will take advantage of your situation and force you to compromise.\n\nThis is ostentation. In the present era the whole world has become pompous, There is no honesty visible anywhere. Unless these disruptive religions and religions are eradicated, no person can be honest. All religions are preaching you about honesty, but they have become the foundation of every kind of dishonesty. They are teaching you dishonesty. They're teaching you that, Which you cannot do!\n\nAll religions and all sects are leading people towards the wrong path. They are turning humans into sheep and not humans. A true and authentic religion turns man into a 'lion' and the lion walks alone, Not in the crowd. That's why he doesn't have to compromise anywhere. Being in a crowd forces people to compromise. Every person is born in a crowd. Keep your mind free and clean from these disorders and religious pollution. You don't need to compromise!\n",

It is one thing to reconsider one's ideology due to differences of opinion on some issues and to work in harmony with the opposing factors by adopting a middle path or by making a compromise, but to betray one's truth and put it in a 'cave' is one thing. Giving is another matter.\n\nIf we think deeply about this matter, we will generally find that our attitude is that we are always trying to achieve something, Be it power, or support from other people! If you fall prey to such temptations, there is still time to be careful. The result of such a weak agreement is always bitter!",

It is not limited by any distance or time.\n\nIf you are impatient, you lose your patience while waiting for some achievement, then understand that this event will never happen in your life. Because being too impatient, losing patience can cause you to lose a lot rather than gaining something. Patience is extremely important if you are waiting for someone, sitting at the door waiting for a friend to arrive, So at that time you are so alert that if you see a passing car and hear any sound nearby, you immediately start looking here and there to see that perhaps he has arrived.

Spring will arrive, Flowers will bloom, But you cannot put any kind of pressure on spring to come. Will rain, The sky will be covered with clouds, The entire thirst of the earth will be quenched, But you cannot put pressure on him. You have to be patient...wait for the right time. Your haste, your haste, your impatience can create a difficult situation for you, Because that can make you extremely confused and confused, At best one may become frustrated, Don't be in such a hurry. I can understand this, Because in every way the Western tradition teaches you only one thing and that is hurry. If you really want to live a life with peace and happiness, then you will have to give up your old habit of hurrying and achieving things quickly, fast pace. Will have to pay tribute.\n\nIn today's era, every person wants to become rich as soon as possible. If you really want to get rich quick, you have to acquire something worthless that won't perish! That thing could also be 'heroin'. The heads of all the religions of the West are against 'drugs', but they do not know the trick of getting faster. Everyone wants to be 'fast'. There is competition among people for this. They want to achieve their objective as soon as possible, but this is not possible. This requires waiting patiently!",
        "card_description": "There are some moments in life where there is only one thing to do and that is wait. The seed of waiting patiently was planted, The child is developing in the womb. The oyster is covering itself with sand particles and slowly forming a pearl.\n\nThis card reminds us that this is the time when we have to be cautiously patient and wait. The condition of the woman seen in the card is exactly similar. He has no excitement or urgency. Patiently she is waiting. The woman has established identification and communication with all the forms of the moon passing in the sky above her head. She has become monogamous with him. He knows that this is the time to have unlimited patience. Nature has to be allowed to take its course, Have to have positive thinking. That woman is neither drowsy, Nor is he in a state of indifference. She knows that after waiting patiently, the moment that comes will be very important. Therefore he has to wait calmly and patiently!",

It was not completely light yet, Therefore, I could not see inside the temple due to darkness. The king was saying- 'My God! I am the dust of your feet, I am not a person! Have mercy on me!' At the same time the priest was praying the same prayer, but the words might be different, \"I am not a man, have mercy on me.\"\n\nAt the same time, a third voice was heard in both of their ears and along with the voice, a slight light also appeared there. In that weak light both of them saw a poor beggar from the city praying and saying, 'O Lord! I am the dust of your feet, I am not a person, Have mercy on me!'\n\nThe king blinked his eyes and looked at the priest and said, 'Look! Who is he who says that he is not a person, but just a beggar? The king may say that he is not a person, The chief priest may say that he is not a person, But a beggar? How arrogant he is! What cunningness!'\n\nBoth of them started laughing at the beggar's trick that he also wanted to be like the king and the priest! He was also pretending not to be a person. The king and his chief abbot started considering it as an insult. In fact they can say that they are not a person, Because everyone knows that he is not a normal person. Even God knows that they are not like that. He has merely been polite. But that poor beggar? How much humility is there in him!\n\nRemember, your so-called saints and mahatmas are humble in front of God so that they can be considered special in the eyes of people. But in reality they are religious, they are spiritual, Those who do not display their humility and modesty, do not pretend to be a normal person. They are normal people, human beings in the true sense.\nThe general consciousness of man is extremely incredible, it is amazing ! Because it is usually normal. But his ego and pride do not allow him to remain like that. He wants to look different, unusual.\n\nThe moment you have such pride and ego, your consciousness does not allow you to remain normal and ordinary. Makes your original nature disappear. At a time when your consciousness is generally normal, in accordance with your nature, At the same time you become amazing and extraordinary in yourself!\n",

When we see it with our normal consciousness.\n\nWe clean our houses, take care of the garden, prepare food etc. We do all the small and big tasks with full dedication and love. We do all these things with normal consciousness, It is done without any vindictive thought or discrimination.

Night and day, summer and winter, you know everything. Knowledge is transmitted within you only through your experiences. In the same way, after living your whole life simply and easily, when you start dying, at that moment you can enjoy death also, Because you have enjoyed your life to the fullest.\n\nOnly that person, who has enjoyed his life, is capable of enjoying death and can also defeat death.\n\nTry to live life deeply, live fully and live holistically. So when death knocks at your door, be ready to welcome death like a ripe fruit. The way a slight gust of wind comes and a ripe fruit drops down from the tree. Sometimes the fruit automatically drops due to its own weight and being completely ripe without any gust of wind, similarly the process of death is also there.\n\nEvery person is searching, has some search or the other, But even after so much searching nothing is found! That moment will be great indeed, When the person stops searching! When there is no search in a person's life, No longing, nowhere to go, Nor is there anything to gain. Don't be in a hurry to achieve something quickly or quickly. Don't make any arrangements for that. Let the time come. You will find wonderful peace and a new light. You should be especially alert on 'meditation'. Only meditation will bring such light into your life that each night death will not be death but will be an open door to divinity for you.

They have given you a certain shape and identity, Which is called 'Naam Roop' in Hindi.\n\nIf you are melting or boiling, then you have no boundaries or walls. You don't know where you are? Where do you end and where do others begin? You are walking with the people. Gradually the overall circles, or overall obstructions, become invisible.\n\nThe reality is like this.

But at that time the person becomes invisible, only his presence remains. He himself disappears and only a kind of silence prevails at that place. His entire knowledge vanishes, only his innocence remains.\n\nAnother name for maturity is feeling. There is a kind of aroma when ripe. Maturity imparts a beauty to a person's personality, Makes one intellectually mature. Fills you with love. The person's overall actions are full of love, All his inactions are also full of love. The life of a mature person is full of love and his death is also full of love. In a way, he is a flower who keeps showering love on others.\n\nWestern philosophers have interpreted maturity in a different way. He says that a person becomes mature through deep experiences in his life. You have so much life experience that no one can deceive you.\n\nBut such maturity is worldly and temporary. Although in this world you will find many such mature people. But the maturity we are talking about is completely spiritual and permanent. Such maturity makes you easy-going, gentle and generally loving.\n\nYou are connected with existence in such a way that wherever you exist, you remain connected with existence. You can go into the past as much as you want or speculate about the future as much as you want, but it has nothing to do with your present. Wherever you are, there is your present, wherever you are there is existence and there is a continuous shower of happiness to welcome the existence.\n",

It can move anywhere, in any direction, without any change within it, without any subtraction, without any difference in joy and happiness. She is standing at that point in time, where there is access to centrality and comprehensiveness.\n\nThe glowing aura around the figure symbolizes the figure's inner light and its protection.

The reason for this is that they have become the norm, people remember not only Buddha but Jesus Christ, Prophets etc. because they are neglected and exceptions by today's man.\n\nAt the time when this world was completely moral, there was no possibility of any saint coming. At a time when this world was truly religious, there was no need for religion. Generally people were of religious nature. There was no need for religions at that time.

The need for discipline arises where there is indiscipline. People talk about health where there is ill health.\n\nEvery person today is living a life like a patient, carrying various kinds of wounds. Each person is carrying his own wounds. These wounds are physical as well as spiritual. Because of your own ego your entire existence has become a wound.\n\nYou are roaming around carrying the same wounds i.e. problems, difficulties and sorrows.

        "card_content": "The basic secret is to concentrate while entering the temple of God. The actual meaning of the word listening here is to concentrate, It's about forgetting yourself and listening patiently. When you listen attentively to someone, you forget yourself. Where are you, what are you etc. things become inactive. Unless you forget yourself, you cannot listen to anyone. You can accept it only by focusing your total attention on one point.\n\nWhenever a person listens to something carefully, then understands that he is absorbing that thing completely. Due to continuous intake, its reservoir gets completely filled and its ability to absorb becomes unlimited and its connection with existence gets connected. If you abandon receptivity, everything you want to receive escapes from you. Therefore, it is necessary that you become a storehouse of unlimited receptivity. If this happens then all your closed doors will open automatically.\n\nReceptivity can be active and productive only when you listen to something and become absorbed in it. If you do this, then you will no longer care who you are. Where are you? What else are you doing! In a way you become passive.\n\nIf you are completely self-conscious and self-centred, then you usually just pretend that you are listening, While you don't listen. It is a different matter that sometimes in an accepting posture you indicate acceptance by nodding your head or sometimes you say \"yes\", but the truth is that you do not listen at all! Unless you concentrate patiently, you cannot receive.\n\nThe moment you listen attentively, you continue to receive completely, you become a storehouse, whose capacity for reception becomes unlimited and your connection directly crosses over and connects to existence. But remember, by adopting an aggressive or conqueror's attitude, by abandoning receptivity, you cannot achieve anything new, Attaining God is far away. Not only be receptive, but become a storehouse of unlimited receptivity, The closed doors of holistic directions will automatically open towards you. At that time you will become the great source of active power. An ocean of womanly receptivity!",

So much so that it started overflowing! Receptivity has been presented in a simple manner by giving the example of the lotus pattern and the womb.\n",

Faith and trust will emerge in your life only when you keep your mind and brain aside. And then ?\n\nThen your life will overflow with infinite power. Then your life ceases to be ordinary, it becomes completely divine.\n\nFaith is everything in life. Knowing that existence is our mother, Nature is the source of our life, And that existence and nature cannot be against us, cannot be harmful to us, Seeing and understanding them, faith and trust arise within us. At that time, negative forces like fear, doubt, and uncertainty etc. go away.\n\nSuppose a person has to jump, But before jumping the person has a doubt in his mind. If he thinks that the doubt should go away before he jumps, then remember that time will never come, because doubt is a self-generated process of a person. Once a doubt arises, a second, third, fourth, etc. is created from it. Exactly the same is the process of developing faith. Once faith is created, the second, third, fourth, etc. are created from it.\n\nWhenever you start something new, a kind of uncertainty surrounds you. No one can start with a whole heart. At that time there is always doubt somewhere, But don't pay that much attention to doubt, Instead, strengthen your faith and belief. Gradually the doubts will reduce and faith will become stronger.\n\nSo keep in mind that if you think that you will start only when the doubts are cleared, So it is definitely impossible for this to happen.

It is not that others have thanked you or done you any favor.\n\nGreed or greed, in some form or the other, remains hidden somewhere in love. You will be surprised to know that the English word LOVE is taken from Sanskrit लोभ (LOBH). Lobha means greed, with time the same word gradually became LOVE. 'Love' means a kind of greed is hidden in the background of love, Whereas in true friendship there is a feeling of sacrifice or giving something for each other.\n\nIn friendship, there is a feeling of friendship in true sense i.e. giving everything to the other (friend) without any expectation. Being ready to give your every happiness, every sorrow and every comfort and the one who accepts it gratefully without any expectation is a friend. Friendship and friendship! There is no question of needing each other here. There is no question here that when you fall into any danger, your friends rush to save you! It is absolutely inconsistent that he may come, Can't even come! But remember, if he does not come, you should not complain to him. If he comes, you are grateful, if he doesn't come, still grateful!\n\nFriendship is a great art, There is 'art', in friendship there is no specific person, whom we can especially call our friend! In friendship it does not happen that you maintain friendship only with some special or certain people. If your thought is like this, then understand that it is your rotten and corrupt thought. Instead of establishing friendship, it is better to be friendly to everyone. The feeling of friendship should become a special quality of yours or an identity of your personality.\n\nThe mutual relationship of the entire existence should be friendly. If you have a sense of friendship with existence, Then existence will shower upon you a thousandfold feeling of friendship. If you throw flowers towards existence, existence will in return cover you with innumerable flowers. Friendship is the mirror of life. Your face is reflected in the mirror. Have a sense of friendship. Your entire life will be filled with the feeling of friendship!",

Then see how much spirituality flows inside you! There will be no visible distance between life and temple. Look inside your life! There will be no sadness anywhere. Have you ever seen a tree sad and worried? Have you seen any bird worried and distressed? Have you ever seen any animal restless? No, His life is not like that. Nature has its own order, There is specificity. Man can make mistakes, but not nature!\n\nEvery moment of life is meant to be celebrated. Every moment of life is full of joy. You just have to find the source of that happiness. Make life itself a celebration, when you enter the temple, there should be a feeling of joy and happiness on your face. The temple is not for the serious-faced. You look back at your life. Do you see sadness anywhere? No.\n\nMay you always remain normal. Don't try to be clever and very intelligent. Have you seen any creature going mad? Madness is a delusion of yours. Life is not like this. There is some intelligence in our life and there is also some foolishness. Try not to be wiser and more foolish. Life is a tree, try to understand it.\n\nBut, remember one thing here, animals can only play, While man enjoys it, Celebrates the festival. Enjoying, celebrating, celebrating festivals is the exclusive right of the only human being. Animals can't do this. They cannot enjoy and rejoice. Animals can only play. There is a feeling of gratitude and blessedness hidden in joy and celebration. This is a gift given only to man, but it is something to be understood and felt. Existence has poured out its ocean of immense love for us to maintain an atmosphere of joy and celebration. There is a need to squeeze joy from those sources!\n\nTransforming every moment in the flow of life into joy and celebration is a great art of living. Don't stop the feelings of joy rising within you, Don't wait for another moment, You can turn any moment into joy and celebration. You don't need to search for anything. Life needs joy and celebration, and you have it. Life is necessary to celebrate and enjoy. Trees, birds, moon and stars are needed for joy and celebration and they are all available to you.\n\nIf you are a king, with a golden crown on your head, you are in a special bond. You cannot celebrate and celebrate your heart, Because till date no one has seen any emperor or king dancing and jumping in any street and enjoying. Because a king or emperor remains imprisoned under certain special formalities.\n\nWhy don't you rejoice? The reason is that something has disappointed you greatly, Because of which you can neither dance nor sing, Nor can we rejoice. Your life has become the life of a handicapped and lame person. You consider yourself very ordinary, In another sense, you are a victim of inferiority complex and frustration. You don't have anything special, because of which your joy and celebration is dead, But who told you that joy and celebration require a special achievement?\n\nYou can enjoy and be happy even by living a normal life. Even your ordinary life will be considered extraordinary compared to others. There is no need for any special occasion or any prior preparation to celebrate. If you keep thinking like this, you will never be able to enjoy it. Similarly, life will come to an end while living the life of a beggar.\n\nWhatever comes your way to live life, adopt it, Find joy in it and forget all the negative things and have a positive attitude. Dancing, jumping and singing songs are not a part of life. You have many ways to express your inner happiness.\n\nEmbrace life within yourself. Adopt maximum openness, have maximum sensory access, All those things are scattered around you, which can make your life joyful and festive. You need to change your thinking, To look at life from a positive perspective!",
        "card_description": "The three women seen in the picture are dancing, enjoying the rain and gusts of wind. She is reminding us that external circumstances do not have to be favorable for joy and celebration. We do not need to wait for any special festival or any special day to celebrate. There is no need for a drizzle of rain or sunshine to enjoy. Happiness originates from the happiness or inner happiness of a person. When the same joy crosses the limits, it is expressed in song, dance or laughter, at that time tears of gratitude well up in the eyes.\n\nWhen you select this card, it indicates that there are many small and big opportunities in your life, which you can express in joy and celebration. There is no need to wait for a particular day, occasion or favorable circumstances to express happiness. You can express your joy at any time, Because that happiness is scattered all around you, there is no need to go looking for it anywhere.",

        "card_content": "Turning inward does not mean turning completely. Going inward does not mean going inside. Turning inward generally means that you are constantly running through life to satisfy desires here and there, but repeatedly fall into the pit of disappointment and frustration. If your every wish is not satisfied, it makes you sad and frustrated. Desires are not satisfied merely by wishing or desiring, You may never reach your goal. In such a situation, peace within your mind is impossible.\n\nWhen you will understand the truth that running after desires leads you to nowhere, then you will stop running after them. You won't need to make any effort to stop. It automatically gets postponed. Even if you make any effort, your running will start again.\n\nIn the same way, if you make any effort to go into your inner self, then you should understand that you are still running in the outer world! The more you try to turn within, the more you will go outside. All the journeys undertaken are related to the outside, not the inside.\n\nThen how can you go within? The simple answer is that you are always present within yourself. No aim to go up from there. The moment you stop chasing desires, your entire journey also gets postponed. The moment your mind becomes free from the fog of desires, you become stable within yourself. This is called turning inward.\n\nOnce you are centered within yourself, all your energy cannot move anywhere else. One thing to keep in mind here is that turning inward does not mean that you are moving inward. When all your energy is concentrated and stable in one place, when there is no activity of any kind, when everything is still and quiet, Everything is closed, You cannot make efforts anywhere seeing the futility of desires. Now you can't go anywhere. There is a permanent energy store inside. The external world is stable, You are totally present. This is called turning inwards.",
        "card_description": "The woman seen in the picture has a carefree smile on her face. In reality this woman is observing the strange activities of the mind. She is not taking any decision on that. Neither stopping him nor verifying him. She is merely observing, Just like she has become a part of the traffic crowd by standing on the road! Or standing on the banks of the pond, Are you looking at the waves rising on the surface of the water? In such a situation, the clownishness of the mind is making him happy. When the mind is jumping here and there, running towards activities here and there, in such a situation it attracts your attention and wants to forcibly involve you in the game.\n\nAcquiring the skill to distance oneself from the mind is a great blessing. This is called real meditation. In this neither any mantra is chanted nor any vow is made, Rather, in this process one has to keep an eye on the movement of the mind, in the same way as one has to keep an eye on the behavior of any other person. In this way you can meditate by focusing inside your mind.",

        "card_content": "The person who lives in the present, Lives only in the present, He always feels fresh and young. He is neither a child nor an old man! He remains young till his last breath.\n\nAlways remember one thing that the past has no existence in the present. To cling to the past is to cling to death. This is an extremely dangerous situation, Because in such a situation your life stops, The blocker faces the situation. Its adverse consequences are not only your present, Your future also gets blocked.\n\nSmall children never look back, they always look forward. There is nothing in his past that he can look back on. All that is there for them is their future. An old man never looks towards the future, Because now only death is left for him in the future! They keep ignoring him. They always look backwards at their past. All they have are memories of the past. Today, their past seems beautiful to them, But in the past when they were living in that situation, they could not enjoy it.\n\nThat person remains young till the last breath of his life, who never clings to his past. His body may have aged but his consciousness always remains healthy and young. Time is constant, time neither goes anywhere nor comes from anywhere. In our common language we often say that time is passing. That time has come or a certain time has gone.\n\nTime has been divided into three parts: past, present and future, but this division is limited to the mind only. The reason for this is that the present does not stay in front of the mind for long, the present very soon becomes the past. Now whatever is in front of the mind is the future.\n\nThe past is that which does not last long before your eyes, The future is that which is not yet in front of your eyes. The present is what is in front of your eyes, but is slowly slipping away and will soon become the past. What is gone is gone. The past can never be the present. Then what is the meaning of being attached to the past and clinging to it? The same thing can be said about the present also. There is no point in clinging to the present, Because this present of yours will soon become the past. Don't cling to future hopes, expectations, fantasies and plans, Because they will all soon become the present and this present becomes the sliding past, Everything is going to be past or present. Everything is slipping out of your hands. Clinging to all this is only inviting misery. Everything will become the past, Then what will be gained by clinging to it and being sad?\n\nYou let it happen, trying to stop it is meaningless, You have to change your perspective. You let events happen, But don't have special expectations from them. Your expectations, hopes, ambitions are the cause of sorrow and disappointment for you. You remain a witness to objects and events. Instead of clinging to them, stay alert and keep an eye on them. Do not keep your mind attached to them, Always remain in an alert state, This is meditation! You remain calm and inner and keep your eyes on time, Keep an eye on them like an eyewitness, all your anxiety, pain, trouble and tension etc. will end.\n\nThis past, present and future are not periods of time. These are all periods of the mind. Past is what has happened, what is happening is in front, that is present and what is going to happen is not in front, that is future.\n\nWhat you lost in the past cannot be brought back in the present. We don't even know what is going to happen in the future, He is invisible. So whatever is there, is present. Therefore, do not trouble yourself by worrying about yesterday and tomorrow. Always live in the present. But do not cling to the present either, because the present will also become the past very soon.\n\nWhatever we hope, imagine or plan is for tomorrow. How will tomorrow be? What results will it bring? We don't know him. Yesterday is already past. Everything in our life will be done tomorrow. Every moment of time is slipping away, so do not be sad by remembering the past. Only when you forget your past will you find joy and happiness.",

That's why she turns that box on her back, as if her box, closed with memories of the past, is a sparkling glass of champagne! Or may he have received some divine blessing! Due to always being stuck in the memories of his past, the doors of his brain are closed and he has become nothing more than a fool! His torn and tattered clothes are a symbol of this.\n\nIt is true that he is not a beggar who can ask for anything from anyone, But what is even more true is that you cannot enjoy the unsought happiness of the present, the automatically available nature, Because you want to live in your past only.\n\nThere is an opportunity before you, where you can accept the truth that the past is gone. You cannot relive memories of your past. It is better to remove the box of past memories to which you are clinging and hang it somewhere forever and live in the present and enjoy the happiness available.",

        "card_content": "What is dream? Dreams are nothing else, when your desires become desires and start dancing in your imagination, at that time you are unable to recognize the reality that lies beneath your imagination. Reality comes to the fore when your dreams are shattered and fantasies become invisible. If you look at an object in the realm of your imagination, you will still not know the true nature of that object.\n\nWhen a beautiful girl passes by your sight, a desire to possess her arises in your mind. Similarly, if a handsome young man passes by a girl, a desire to establish her authority over him may arise in the girl's mind. After that you naturally do not try to know its reality or its reality. Instead, that desire of yours starts taking the shape of a dream about the girl. Then your next desire is to meet that girl and this is where your colorful fantasies begin.\n\nYour colorful imagination starts jumping out of bounds and when reality explodes, your mind colored with dreams gets shattered, this happens to you often. You fall in love with a woman, At that moment the most beautiful thing in the world is in your imagination, But one day suddenly your dream is broken, Imaginations become invisible. The same woman no longer seems as beautiful to you. Now you don't see her the same way you used to see her. You don't believe yourself how you were betrayed by him?\n\nNeither is anyone cheating you, nor can anyone cheat you. The reality is that your desires and your imaginations deceive you, Because this is your created illusion!\n\nA person cannot stay in the world of dreams for long. Sooner or later the reality comes out. This is the reason why all the love affairs that go on become unstable and uncertain. Lovers and lovers are always afraid that each other's reality may not be revealed as per their dreams and imaginations...? And they keep neglecting to know the reality.\n\nThe wife tries to ignore the husband, The husband tries to ignore the wife. They do not try to look at each other directly, Because they are always afraid. They are aware that the world of imagination has disappeared.\n\nIn case of dream breaking, reality emerges in a different way. Husbands no longer look at their wives the way they used to look at them earlier. What happened to them after all? The reality is obvious to both of them. Now the situation is that dreams can never win against reality. The dream world falls apart sooner or later. This keeps happening everywhere.\n\nMan always dreams of various kinds, sometimes of becoming powerful, sometimes of gaining respect and sometimes of reaching a higher level. And when he achieves all this, all he gets is disappointment.\n\nIt is human nature to imagine, dream and wish. This is where dreaming and imagining begin. Remember, man also dreams about those things which he does not have. You can dream of your neighbor's beautiful wife, but you cannot dream of your own wife, no matter how beautiful she is. Whatever remains away from us looks beautiful, When we get close to Him, things slowly begin to change, and reality begins to emerge.\n\nStop dreaming, Being awake means giving up the unconscious sleep in which we normally live, Always be awake and alert, see things as they really are. Once you see your dream disappear, because now you have woken up from your dream, at that time the quality of consciousness will arise in you in a new environment. When you recover from the fog of dreams and are in a waking state, you will feel a distinct change when you wake up the next morning. A change that you have never experienced before! You have woken up from the dream state for the first time. The dream has disappeared, because now awareness has come. You have suddenly woken up from the dream. Now both the dream state and the waking state cannot exist together. When awakening comes, the dream automatically disappears, the entire existence becomes awake.",
        "card_description": "You are going to meet your soulmate on some beautiful magical evening, Which can fulfill all your needs, desires and dreams. Such imagination or the habit of dreaming is found not only in children but also in writers, poets and lyricists. The roots of such imaginations and dreams lie in the memories of the past. Instead of coming out of these dreams and imaginations and facing the real world, we often desire to live in those dreams. These are just children's dreams and childish imaginations!\n\nBut those dreams of yours and your beautiful imaginations, which you want to hold on to so cruelly, In other words, the utopia in which you want to live slowly slips away and the reality is exposed in its naked form! To stop him permanently is just a child's dream! None of your close friends or associates, whether present, want to share your joy with gratitude, and even if they wanted to, they would not be able to do so. True happiness and real happiness cannot be achieved by solving our problems, It is impossible to get it from anyone else. True happiness and real happiness lie within us, which we can achieve by making our inner self full of love and dignity. At that time we can truly share the joy that overflows within us. As soon as the details of dreams and imagination are removed, reality stands before us!",

You add your own illusion or illusion to the form of those things.\n\nThe biggest reason for this is that you are afraid to see things directly in their true form. You know very well that they are not as you see them.\n\nYou think that if you see things as they really are, you won't be able to bear it. That is why to reduce the bitterness of truth, you mix your dreams or imaginations in it. In your dream you have covered a person about whom you think that sweetness must have developed in that person. Is it possible? No, you are deceiving yourself by thinking so, Not anyone else. The result of this is that you find yourself in a very painful situation. The sad situation before you is beyond your imaginations and dreams. Always be careful about this situation. Don't put your responsibilities on others, otherwise you will start dreaming about something else. The situation and the scene present in front of you are projected from your own mind, but you are not able to see it. Your vision does not go towards the projection being made from behind.\n\nTake a theater or cinema hall for example. Your eyes remain fixed only on the screen. The movie you are watching is not actually on the screen. It is the projection of shadow and light by the projector from behind, which appears alive on the screen.\n\nYour brain remains behind many such things and keeps playing the role of a projector. You are always looking at others, because the other person is a screen for you! When you are deeply in love with someone, that person is extremely beautiful and incomparable to you, But when you hate that person, he becomes the ugliest person in the world. Perhaps you are not aware of this or do not realize how the same person, who was very beautiful, becomes ugly?\n\nIn reality, whatever we see is external. We either do not try to reach reality or try to get away from it. Our mind is behind all matters, we use the mind like a projector. We always see others, because there are other people on the screen.\n\nWhen we see something beautiful, we do not think that where there is beauty, there is also flaw. When we love a woman, we find her beautiful. But when the same woman rebukes us on something, we find her ugly. Now the question arises that how can the same person be so beautiful and so ugly?\n\nWhat I mean to say is that as difficult and complex as a situation in life appears from the outside, it is not necessary that it is the same from the inside. The role of our mind is more important behind all this. Happiness and sadness, good and bad, beautiful and ugly, all these are the choices of our mind.\n\nWhen you are in love with someone, that person becomes a garden of beautiful roses for you, there is not even a trace of thorns anywhere. When you start disliking that person, hating him, the roses become invisible, disappear, if there are any left, there are only thorns! And just ugliness, Which you can't see! Have you ever thought carefully about where the beautiful roses disappeared in a single minute?\n\nIf you look carefully, you will realize that the center of events is not the person or the screen you see. The reality is that you are projecting something. When you project love, that person seems loved, When you project hatred onto the same person, that person appears ugly. Don't use your brain to see reality with your mind's eye.\n\nIt's up to your mind to interpret things. Therefore, to know the reality or truth of something, it is important to immediately study your perspective. Don't use your brain, because the root of all problems is your mind.\n\nYou should see small things for their true nature without applying your mind. If you look at a flower, just look at it. Don't say 'Wow! so so beautiful !' Or 'Oops!' Very ugly !' Although your mind will feel uncomfortable doing this. But you naturally keep your mind separate. Gradually your ability to discern the truth will increase.",

Both of them are projecting their imaginations on each other, whatever is in their mind, they want to cover the real face of the other person with their imaginations and dreams. They both have their own dreams and their own fantasies that they want to project into each other. This is the nature of all of us. Where our attachment and love happens, we cover it with our imaginations and dreams. \n\nEvery person has his own perspective of seeing each other. If that which you consider beautiful and the fairy of your dreams, which you consider to be the world of your dreams, suddenly appears ugly and insignificant, then it is certain that you will try to project your imaginations and dreams into it without knowing its reality. Keep avoiding! How you see others depends on your perspective. If your perspective is clear or your perspective is blurry, the object will appear the same.",

He is always engaged in his own protection and security. He remains in self-defense. His access is always protective. For this he continues to struggle continuously. There is always a contrary feeling inside him. There is a feeling of hostility. Whatever prayer and meditation he does is a strategy for his own protection.\n\nA person who has faith knows how to let go. A person with faith knows how to surrender. A person with faith knows how to flow with the flow of the river without pushing. He flows as far as the current takes him. He has so much courage and confidence that he can go anywhere with the flowing current. A person who remains fearful and scared does not have the capacity to surrender. Only a person with strong morale and strong will can surrender, give up everything, Because he has confidence in himself, he is extremely self-confident and can make sacrifices. He has no fear of any kind. He can find the unknown thing, know its reality, Because he has experience of such strange and dangerous journeys. He has the courage to face dangers.\n\nThe life of a person who has faith and trust in others is always full of dangers and troubles. Danger is his refuge, Insecurity is security for him. He wants to reveal the reality. For this he wants to go to the end of existence or sink into the depths of existence. He wants to know more about existence and want to know himself. A person who is strong and capable from within is always ready to surrender himself. He knows that he has no fear in doing so. He considers himself a part of existence. Therefore he does not consider himself a stranger. He considers existence as his everything. Only in existence lies his identity and his existence, otherwise he is nothing! He knows that no one else can play the role he is going to play for survival. That is why he is always ready to search for something in the darkness.\n\nThere are many things which can be achieved by making efforts, but there are also many things which cannot be achieved even by making efforts. Among the things which can be achieved by making efforts are worldly wealth, power, respect and prestige etc. Among the things which cannot be achieved even with efforts, are love, prayer, meditation, truth etc. One should learn the method of waiting. One must also learn how to refrain from making efforts! One must learn how to surrender. A person should also learn whom he should sacrifice and whom he should leave behind.\n\nThe most important secret of life is that one should learn to surrender, learn to let go and have faith in existence.",

That is why the mind does not move towards new efforts to any extent. Man's mind always remains stuck to his past. He wants to stick to old relationships, relatives and acquaintances only. It is in these that he realizes his skills and abilities. Once you are settled and settled, you feel comfortable and at ease there.\n\nThere are many people in our society who start living with a man or a woman. The reason for this is not that they love each other, In fact they are acquainted with each other, Know each other well. Now, if they want to create the same loving relationship with another man or woman, it will be difficult for them, or they will have to make a new effort again.\n\nThe human mind is lazy and lethargic. This slowness and laziness becomes an obstacle for him to make any new effort.\n\nLaziness or lethargy is a negative attitude. One should be brimming with energy. He should be easygoing and simple, not dull and lazy. Being lazy or lethargic means that you have given up your creativity or activity for this universe. You are standing aside, away from the action, while the creative action of this universe is going on continuously.\n\nwhether you are doing something or not, It is not important to you. You should always be full of energy. The things given by nature always look rich and beautiful. They always look glowing and beautiful. There is no laziness there. Life is not stressful.

Have you ever thought deeply about a flowing river? Sometimes its current flows sliding towards the left bank, and sometimes it starts sliding towards the right bank. Sometimes it flows towards the north, and sometimes it flows towards the south. Thus you will see that the flow of the river is inconsistent and contradictory, Nothing is certain as to when its shores will change! But there is definitely uniformity in it. What is hidden, invisible is to end our existence by merging into the ocean! No matter where the river flows, it's only goal is the sea!\n\nExpecting to establish uniformity or identity in the minds of people or the uniformity hidden within them is not a part of the society but is related to the entire universe. Society is a man-made organization. All the tendencies of the society, all the events are conducted according to calculations. Society itself has created all the morals or rules, which are stable at one place. This is the reason why moral people and societies have lived together for centuries. Everything keeps changing, but dead rules still exist constantly. Change is inevitable in all things, but most people stick to old rules and customs.\n\nThat person is called moral, who is externally connected with the society. He lives by the rules. But those rules are not for him. He is for the scriptures, the scriptures are not for him! He follows the rules, but does not follow awareness. If you are always alert to awareness, you will be able to achieve hidden coherence. At that time you will not feel the oddity. In fact, even in adverse circumstances, you will experience the inherent positivity within it. You will feel that he is also like a friend! You can use your enemy as a friend. In a hidden, invisible union, both can become one by falling in love together. Anger is man's enemy but try using it, Make him your friend. Let your love go deep, so that its roots mingle with existence! It is an invisible uniformity 'Love the enemy, Use the opposite situation also, Because what you consider to be opposite and odd, is actually not so.\n\nIf you prefer one of the two options, that would be wrong. If you choose one, you will become prosperous from it. Therefore, positivity and negativity become a part of the hidden invisible unity between life and death, enemy and friend and love and hate.",

As the silence within us becomes more rhythmic, the more we feel pressure. The hidden figure in this card delicately reflects the sweetness of this feeling. The dolphins that form a lane from the heart to the figure's third eye reflect his playful and playful nature. Whenever we are so present that we connect with our heart and see the entire world from our own perspective, then our identity with the entire existence is established. Make your inner being soft and receptive, Because an unfettered joy is waiting for you. That happiness is spread all around you. No one can separate that joy from you.

A good swimmer has such deep faith in the river that he becomes one with the river. He does not catch water by jumping while swimming, He does not put up any kind of struggle, It does not remain rigid and taut.\n\nIf you remain firm, stretched and rigid while swimming in the river, you may also drown in the river. If you remain light and comfortable with the river, the river can protect you with its flow. As it is known that whenever a person dies, his dead body floats in water. This is a miracle! The living person dies by drowning in the river water, Whereas the body of a dead person floats on the surface of water. What happened after all? The dead man knows some secrets of the river, which the living man does not know. The living man was struggling, fighting with the flow of the river. The river looked like an enemy to him, he was afraid of the river, he had no faith in it.\n\nOn the contrary, the dead person had no existence there, so how could he have fought? The river cannot drown any dead body. Surrender means living life the way it is, Just like a good swimmer swims in a river. Life is a river. In the river you either fight, or swim, Either you push the water and move against the current or go with the flow till there, As far as the river takes you!\n\nRiver water is never aggressive, it never struggles, it never fights. The flow of the river makes its way without any fight and struggle. The flow of the river gives many lessons to man. The river stream flows across the hard rocks of the mountains. Hard granite walls stand as obstacles on the way, but the river does not fight them. Does not put up any kind of struggle. It flows silently. The sand of the sea or the sand spread on the banks of rivers will make you aware of a heavy secret that 'ultimately the flowing water of the river wins.' When we thought, how will we cross these terrible mountain rocks? We had a difficult target in front of us. How can water be victorious? But ultimately water wins. Women's power is very beautiful! So don't be hard like a rock. Be soft and smooth like water. Don't be adamant about conquering water. The flow of a river means the flow of life! Like the flow of a river, the flow of life is gentle, pain-free, pleasant and non-violent. Learn to go with the flow of life!",

It will go wherever the river currently takes it. That figure has mastered the art of being patient without any laziness and without any slackness. He is available to flow with the flow of life. No negative thought arises in his mind that I don't like that path, or I want to go through some other path.\n\nAt every moment of life such challenges or such special opportunities are presented before us, In which we have to choose whether we drown in the flow of life or swim with the current of life or try to swim against the current of the river of life. After studying this card the conclusion is that you are still able to swim with the flow of life. Having faith that the life stream will support you. The flow of life will easily take you to where you want to go. You need to have faith and trust!",

You are free from control, the flow of your life is uninterrupted, so you cannot be worried and nervous. There can be no place for despair in your life. The most important formula to remain stress free and carefree in life is – whatever is going to happen, let it happen. You don't know what will happen in the future, Then why worry about future events? Don't have any expectations from the future. Then there will be no question of you being nervous.\n\nNow you must have understood the meaning of controlled life or independent life. But remember, freedom has its own discipline. Freedom does not mean freedom. Discipline should also be created automatically. Discipline imposed from above or by any other force is no less than control. If you are alert and aware, you are automatically controlled and disciplined.\n\nNever apply pressure. Unnecessary control or restraint is a great misfortune for a person. No matter how beautiful any control may appear externally, its internal reaction is very terrible. Under the burden of this kind of duality or control, the person abandons his natural nature due to stress and the flow of life starts getting obstructed. Freedom has its own discipline, Have your own control. Freedom is spontaneous. By imposing control one has to stop the entry of life force into the body.",

It seems that with all the construction going on inside, his body has become like a mummy, which he himself has created for himself. Its appearance has become exactly like that of a dead body. He has clenched his fists. His eyes are open and steady.\nHe has almost become blind. The lower part of his body was completely covered under the table and merged into darkness. The shape of the table is exactly like a knife. The edge of a knife that cuts objects. His world is orderly and perfect, but he is not alive, he is like a dead person. He cannot allow the light shining outside to come inside. Because he is surrounded by controls from all sides inside and out. Unless you are freed from the pressure of controls imposed by external factors, the creative power inherent within you cannot become active.\n\nTherefore, there is a need to adopt the path of a self-controlled, disciplined, free and independent life.",

Moralists are ready to face all difficulties. They are ready to face all kinds of reactions, obstacles and adverse circumstances. They are ready to observe all kinds of strict prohibitions and strict self-control, so that they can appear high in society. In this they get pleasure and prestige. Such people consider themselves holier and higher than other people of the society, such moralists have only one feeling in their mind that you all are sinners and I am a saint.\n\nThe characteristics of a true saint vary greatly. He is not a moralist. He knows how to forgive. He has the experience of being forgiven again and again. He knows the limitations of man. Because he has endured a lot while passing through those boundaries. He can forgive, Because he has a deep understanding of it.\n\nThe moralist does not understand. He does not have real knowledge of the actual situation. He can never forgive. Satisfy your ego, He has the illusion of proving himself superior and considering others as inferior. A person who is not moral has to face two types of difficulties. The first difficulty he faces comes from outside. Because by being unethical he starts losing people's respect. Respect and honor are most precious in this world, Because it confirms people's ego. The moment a person loses respect and honor received in the society, the ego gets injured. The second difficulty for the immoral person is internal. When the respect of an immoral person starts getting destroyed in the outside society, he experiences inner terror. The conscience of the conscience disappears, Because a person's respect and good thoughts are all created by the external society.\n\nIf you are moral, then understand that there are two types of pressure on you from society: external and internal. In this way you are forced to be crushed between two stones, you have no other option but to live this double life. Even if there is a path, it is not for cowards. A coward can never be immoral and an immoral person can never be cowardly.\n\nThe moment the stream of society meets existence, you are associated with society, The moment the coherence of society ceases to exist, you become distant from society. But a true moral person does not care about all these things. He is always ready to face the difficulties that arise in his life. A truly moral person takes his decisions based on his own awareness. He does not care about religions, sects, sermons etc. He considers the morality taught in religions as an irony. The morality established by religions is different from the morality prescribed for the individual in general. General morality arises from self-awareness. Real morality is easily acceptable and pressure-free, which is stable within the individual.",

If you give up fighting and start swimming with the mainstream, gradually you will no longer be able to separate yourself from the total existence.\n\nEveryone is trying to move against the flowing current. For that he is trying to fight the river itself, Because fighting is an expression of a person's dissatisfaction. A person's ego is satisfied by constant fighting and giving challenges. All the powerful countries in the world always create an atmosphere of war and fighting because it satisfies their ego.\n\nTo satisfy a person's ego, the cycle of fights, challenges etc. has to be kept in motion continuously. Every moment you will have to fight with someone. Once you stop fighting, suddenly you will feel as if the bicycle has fallen off! Ego does not exist without fight.\n\nNever put pressure on any person to do any work, do not force him. Exactly the same applies to you too. Never force yourself to do anything. Allow events to happen, only then will the existence of this universe continue to function through you. There are two ways to do anything in this universe: first, you do it yourself or existence, and someone else makes you do it! If you do, you will create worry and trouble for yourself. So don't stop what happens.\n\nOne moment we are here and the next moment we are gone. Wherever we are at that moment. Even for as long as we are, in that ordinary moment we create so much disturbance, so much noise, so many fights, quarrels and fights. How much anger, hatred and debate they create! How many possibilities, happiness, secrets and hopes of life are hidden in that ordinary moment, all of them we lose because of fights, quarrels, anger, hatred and malice! And in the next moment we are somewhere else, where everyone goes, but no one comes!\n\nThere is only one way to be free from all these inconsistencies and ironies, do not come between yourself and yourself. You, put yourself (your ego) aside, Don't come in between. If you learn as much as you can about how to push yourself aside during this process, then you've learned everything! After that you will be aware that everything will happen on its own without any hindrance, there will be no fights, no conflicts and no one's ego will be injured.",

When a shadow-like picture is seen in its background, it stirs the mind of the person. To conquer a fortress, the two figures fight, It is often seen that explosive anger hides deep inner feelings.

This statement of Jesus is very relevant in this matter that unless you have an innocent mind like a child, you cannot enter the kingdom of God.\n\nThe mentality of a four to five year old child is childlike and innocent. This is such an innocent mentality, where there is no line of demarcation between deception, lie-fraud, respect-insult, hatred-love, good-bad etc. As the same child grows older, he gradually starts considering himself the smartest and most intelligent person due to the knowledge he receives through various mediums and institutions. There is a situation when his stubbornness or his false ego becomes his personality. He cannot accept anyone else's dominance over him. A person keeps carrying the unnecessary burden of borrowed artificial knowledge, thoughts, theories etc. in his mind throughout his life.\n\nPeople who have acquired knowledge remain extremely cautious, their personality does not come out openly. In the same way, all of you have become intelligent and clever. You read books, took knowledge of spirituality, studied in temples, mosques and churches, you have acquired all this knowledge through other means. Whatever kind of knowledge you have acquired. Its roots are not connected to you, yet you are sitting on the same heap of garbage in the form of knowledge, maintaining the illusion of making yourself proud! You pretend to consider yourself smarter and more intelligent than others!\n\nYour mind always remains entangled in this maze. The way many different types of things are scattered in a small room, In the same way, you have filled different opinions, principles, systems, religious sects etc. in your small brain. Who always collide with each other. You remain so entangled in the conflict of those thoughts that you forget your natural nature and satisfy your ego by taking on a borrowed personality.\n\nSomeday, during your free time, close the door of your room and sit down and start writing down the thoughts going on in your mind at that time. You will immediately understand what is going on in your brain! The conflict of thoughts going on in the brain will surprise you! These thoughts will surround you like dark clouds. Due to these, you will not be able to realize your innocent mentality. Therefore, it is necessary that you protect your real identity by abandoning the negative thoughts that have entered your mind.\n\nDo not collect garbage of thoughts in your mind, do not walk with the burden of thoughts in your mind. Many people make this mistake. We keep carrying the burden of unnecessary thoughts in our mind, Whereas they have no need, from wherever they get the burden of thoughts like newspaper, TV, temple, mosque etc., they fill it in the small chamber of their mind and one day they become uncomfortable throughout their life and one day they slip and fall. To attain spiritual enlightenment, remove the filth of thoughts from your mind and know yourself.\n\nYour mind is always entangled in different thoughts. There are many types of resolutions and options in the mind. Everything remains in disarray. Where are you at that time? What are you doing? In this way, they keep pushing you into internal conflict by keeping your mind confused about where are you going etc. In such a situation, you will not realize that your mentality is innocent. To avoid this, you should remove all kinds of unruly thoughts. If you can do this, your mind will become lighter and whatever garbage is there in your brain will be cleared. In such a situation you will be able to recognize yourself.",

In such a situation the person's mind becomes unstable. If the task feels difficult, he chooses another option. Where two options are in front and both seem difficult, then the person compromises in his mind and makes a decision and jumps between the two.\n\nWhenever you try to choose the middle path instead of facing such a situation, then you are definitely wasting your precious life. You have to go horse riding. There are two horses standing in front of you, one black and the other white. Sometimes your mind tells you to ride on black and sometimes on white.

You can either become absorbed in existence or you can become separate from existence in yourself. Both things are not possible together. To be centred in oneself means to be separate, to be in oneself means to become an 'island' separated from the vast land, surrounded by ocean waters from all sides. Being isolated means building a boundary wall around yourself. To be different means to draw a line between 'this is me' and 'that is not me'.\n\nIn this way, the meaning of the line of distinction between 'I' and 'not I' is to freeze within oneself like ice. If you would like such a life, then of course, the flow of life cannot remain dynamic for long. If you are constantly in motion, your 'self' will no longer exist. This is the reason why most people often freeze like solid ice. There is no excitement or warmth inside them, they lack love. Since there is excitement and warmth in love, they should not be afraid of love! If there is excitement inside them, they will start melting and the boundary created around them will automatically disappear. No walls exist in love. There is no boundary even in happiness. Because love and happiness are not as cold as ice.\n\nLove is a different name, God is another name. Yet love is better than God. Because God or Ishwar has been destroyed by spiritualists! Whereas love is absolutely pure and spotless.\n\nTherefore, leave your ego, not the world. The world is not a problem.

At that time you will neither have any feeling of superiority, No inferiority complex!\n\nThe Creator has made you great. This superiority belongs to the soul. It is not possible to compare it. Where you try to compare, With that comes a feeling of inferiority. So don't compare, remain eternal and great.\n\nOnce you understand this truth, this problem will not arise again. You are born superior. Not only you, every thing, every unit of this creation is superior. The whole existence is superior, Because existence is one and you are a part of that existence. There is no one superior or great in this existence, Neither is anyone inferior or insignificant!\n\nEvery person in this world is so superior and unique that every kind of comparison is meaningless, totally wrong, But you are completely unaware of your superiority. In fact you have never tried to know about your existence. You never faced yourself. You never paid any attention to that. It has become your destiny to always consider yourself insignificant and inferior. The greatest people who have achieved a place in history, initially considered themselves inferior in a similar way. It is possible that their way of considering themselves inferior might have been of a different kind. But it is an absolute truth that no person can really be the best or consider himself the best.\n\nThere are unlimited things in this universe for a person to learn in life. Not just humans, You can learn a lot from animals, trees, plants, sky, clouds, birds, rivers etc. But here no question of copying or imitation arises. You can learn a lot from a river. You can learn from a rose. Imagine yourself as a rose, You don't need it though, But you can learn a lot from the rose flower.\n\nYou see how soft and delicate the rose is! Yet how strong and tough it becomes in natural storms like gust of wind, rain, unbearable heat of intense sun etc. It may fade away under the cover of darkness as evening approaches, but it is not worried about that! But within a moment he appears happy and laughing again! You should learn from Rose how to live life! When strong gusts of wind come, the rose is not afraid, Doesn't panic, Instead he dances with great joy! Even though it is raining heavily, it is raining with scorching heat of summer, yet the rose keeps spreading its free humor without worrying about its future, Because he is complete in himself! There are no feelings of inferiority in him.\n\nWhen we compare someone, one is a symbol of smallness and the other is a symbol of gravity. When we don't compare, every kind of smallness and gravity goes away. Later only we are left.\n\nIf you take a look around you, you will realize that everyone has their own needs. All things considered, everyone is incomparable and unique. Each one complements the other. No one in the universe is either high or low.",

Do you think that the oak wishes that its trunk should be hollow like bamboo? Is the bamboo jealous of the oak tree because the oak tree is bigger and its leaves change color in autumn? The importance here is that if two trees have such feelings towards each other, then how ridiculous it would be! But for us humans it has become a habit, Which is very difficult to leave!\n\nLet us face this situation. It often happens that someone who is more beautiful, more intelligent, stronger, more knowledgeable or appears to be happier than you!

It seems to be rolling and tumbling behind life. Such is the nature of the mind, Naturally it does not stay with the person's life. When you see a flower, you feel as if you have probably seen it. Flowers never remain the same for long! His life stream has flowed ahead. You look at a river, But in the next moment we are not able to see that river again, because its flow has flowed ahead. Place your feet in the flowing stream of the river and again the next moment when you step foot, that stream is no more, because the river keeps on flowing continuously, just like life! The state of mind does not remain the same for long. The thought or emotion that has arisen in the mind now does not remain the same the next moment. The flow of life continues to flow forward.\n\nInitially it becomes difficult for a person to estimate how he can survive outside the zero situation. Trees and plants grow by coming out of the state of emptiness, The moon and stars remain in motion, Existence exists outside the void, But there is no problem and no difficulty there. It is only man who loses his existence by moving away from his mind. If you remain at one with the mind, you will become a reliable and trustworthy person. But in reality your connection with the mind turns into disconnection, Because the flow of life has moved ahead. The mind is always occupied with experiences that have already occurred, Whereas life is always open to experiences that have not happened yet. Then how is the union of the two possible? After this, gradually the mind becomes completely closed within itself. Not only this, The mind becomes frightened after looking at life. After this, life becomes a burden on the mind. Why does the mind get scared looking at life? Because the mind knows that if you look at life, you will be proven wrong. It is better to close your eyes and not look at life at all. Don't even listen about life, As if you are a victim of deafness!\nLife is a continuous flow of birth. Every moment it dies and takes a new birth, but you continue to carry the same old mind. You cannot fit in anywhere in any situation. You don't fit in with anyone, and there is some difficulty where you are. If you become a flow or river of formless consciousness, everything will automatically fit into place. Then you will fit in with life and life will fit in with you. Suddenly everything will be right and then life will not seem like a burden.",

On top of that, he reprimands him to walk at a fast pace and work hard and reach the top quickly. The owner is wearing a cock cap on his head, a symbol of power.\n\nIn this phase of yours, if life seems to be dangling between the grave, then you still have time, Throw the person on your back by shaking your shoulder, Then you see how it feels to walk without a burden. You have to decide your destination yourself. Only you can make your dreams come true, but unless you are free from the burden of others' expectations, you will not be able to move towards realizing your dreams. Now is the time for you to think about yourself. It is possible that all the dreams exist in your mind, but they cannot bend you with their burden.

Unless you do some in-depth research, you can't figure out what you've really been doing.\n\nAs soon as you grow up, society starts teaching you at every step to follow this path, Behave like this. Don't follow that path etc. In this way you gradually start becoming a hypocrite, Start becoming deceitful and deceitful.\n\nThe person who first coined the phrase 'Honesty is the best method'. That person must have been a sly trickster indeed! Honesty is not a method, a system or a device and if it is a method or a political system, then it is not honesty.\n\nThere are three words in the English language which have a deep relationship with each other. Those words are - Policy, Politeness and Politics. These three words originate from the same root. The conclusion of all three is the same. People with political backgrounds use these three words very skillfully.\n\nWhen you meet a friend, why do you smile and shake hands? What is the need for this? If you don't feel good about smiling, why do you smile? Because you have to do that. This is a policy, this is politics! Because someday you may need that person's help.\n\nSome scholar has said that 'Power corrupts man.' To some extent this statement is correct, but not true! Power or strength does not corrupt a person. Although superficially it appears that upon attaining power, one becomes corrupt, But in reality it is not so. In fact, they are corrupt people, who are always in search of power, When they do not have any power or authority, they do not show their corruption. When they gain power, they become free, Because the common man does not have the power to stop them. As soon as one gets strength, the real face of the person comes to the fore.\n\nPower or strength never corrupts any person. On the contrary, it is the corrupt people who are eager to gain power. When they get power, So they misuse power to fulfill their desires and aspirations!\n\nA person may be extremely polite. When he seeks political office or power, he displays greater humility, Which we know very well. We also know that the person has been simple and humble throughout his life, That's why we vote for him. When he gains power, he is never the same again! People wonder how power corrupts!\n\nIn reality that humility was a pretense, a false ostentation! He was humble because, Because he was weak, He had no strength, There was no power. He was afraid that powerful people might crush him. His politeness, he had a policy, He had politics! Now he doesn't need to be afraid. Now no one can destroy it by crushing it. Now he can come forward with his real face. Now he looks corrupt!\n\nThe company owner or office boss harasses you, If it hurts you, you will come home and trouble your wife. The wife, being irritated, will take out her anger on her child and will scold him. If the child is old-fashioned, he will vent his anger on the toy and break it. Well, this sequence will continue.

The one who speaks sweetly and has an innocent looking face asks people to trust him, In fact that is not his real face, Wearing a mask.

You have to understand the whole array of sin and criminal sentiment. Unless you create criminal feelings in a person, you cannot force that person to adopt a certain ideology or accept any concept.\n\nBut, once you instill the feeling of guilt in a person's mind, then understand that you have taken from that person all the courageous power that was there in him. By creating a sense of guilt in that person's mind, you destroyed the adventurous potential inherent in him. You killed that person's human potential! He can never be independent or free. The criminal feeling in his mind will force him to become dependent, He will take refuge in some Messiah, some religious leader or an angel of God, Because his guilt will continue to put pressure on him\n\nIt is a common thing to create a feeling of guilt in a person's mind. Start calling mistakes and mistakes as 'sins'. It is human nature to make mistakes or make mistakes, But calling it a 'sin' is a different thing. In arithmetic, if a child adds two and two and writes five instead of four, then he is called careless or foolish, it is not called a sin. There is no feeling of guilt in the mind of that child.\n\nThe emergence of criminal sentiments is not a natural matter or a spontaneous event. It is created by priests, mullahs and pastors etc. By creating this criminal spirit, they show human bravery. The entire history of the religious world is related to the word guilt. In fact, it is a very toxic word! You should always be alert about this! Never use the word guilt, as it takes deep roots in your unconscious mind. You will not find guilt in any animal, That is why he remains beautiful and innocent.\n\nIdeally a corrupt man. Once you set out to establish an ideal, understand that you will never be able to feel comfortable, You will never be able to experience peace and satisfaction, whether at home or outside. Your dissatisfaction will remain a shadow of the ideal you want to fulfill. The more the feeling of dissatisfaction increases within you, the more your ideal will move away from you.\n\nIf you are not dissatisfied with yourself, if you accept yourself as you are, your ideal can be established immediately, may be complete, Because perfection is your nature.\n\nApart from the feeling of guilt created by the abbots, pundits, mullahs or priests, there is another type of crime which is created by some other force. This type of crime makes sense in itself! Such a feeling of guilt arises in your mind only when you are dissatisfied with your present, When you think there's more to life than this, but you're not working hard enough to get it! In such a situation, a feeling of guilt will arise in your mind. You may start to feel as if you yourself have stunted your own growth. You will start thinking of yourself as incompetent, lazy, unconscious etc. It is from here that a kind of crime is created in your mind. This crime is of a different type altogether. This thought arises in your mind that despite being capable, you could not utilise your potential, So you become plagued with a kind of guilt.\n\nThere is another type of guilt, which, although spiritual, is not related to any temple, mosque or church. This feeling of guilt arises in you when you do not fulfill your responsibilities.",

This feeling of guilt becomes a permanent headache for us.\n\nThus we become surrounded by self-created clouds of doubt and confusion. We feel so inferior because of the guilt that arises in our own mind, that life presents us with beautiful gifts, We can't even see him! The joy and happiness that is to be gained from the present slips away and passes away with time.\n\nWe have always been noble and good people, Very loving approach, more aware and conscious, full of self-confidence. But when we try to punish ourselves for our failures, we become trapped in a cycle of disappointment, frustration, and paralysis that we can never escape from. All the brightness of life gets lost in the darkness of despair.\n\nSo learn from your mistakes and have confidence in yourself as you are. The guilt itself will disappear.",

It is also an indisputable truth that people become alert and cautious only when the arrow hits deep into their hearts, This results in sorrow and sadness.\n\nThere are two types of sorrow or pain. The first grief is like you have lost a friend and you are sad about it. If a person dies then his grief is different\nIs of variety. Such grief subsides with the passage of time.\n\nBut there is another kind of sorrow, which remains permanently attached to our existence. There is no definite reason for it. Now you must have become aware of the meaninglessness of life. You set out to do something, but you have become so capable that you look ahead through these things. You know that it does not exist, that is why you become sad. When the veil of illusion is removed from your eyes, sorrow and sadness are visible in front of you.\n\nYou cannot remain in deep confusion for long. Sooner or later, when you come out of the illusion, sadness appears in front of you. Now you are free from illusion i.e. free from illusion. You have seen those things for which you had hoped so greatly, But now you can see that all your hopes are baseless or nothing is going to happen that you expected. Similarly, following hopes and expectations, one day a person chooses to die. With death, everything about that person fails, wealth, relatives, friendship etc. everything fails sooner or later. The final destination of everything is death, with death everything ends. After this the person becomes trapped, After being freed from the web of illusion, a person becomes his true self. He has neither any hope left nor trust in anyone! Now he neither has any illusion nor any illusion left! He can do whatever he wants. If you don't do it, life will become a burden.\n\nWhen a person reaches such a state, a beautiful chapter begins. It is from here that the transformation of a person begins. When a person becomes free from illusion and illusion, he can make any new discovery. When the world has no expectations from you, you can go towards your inner self. When you have failed in the outer world, Therefore, searching for your inner self is also a kind of illusion!",

Hearing this, Anand said, 'You all have a misunderstanding. I am not crying for them, but for myself, Because I stayed with him continuously for so many years, yet could not achieve anything.\n\nAnand remained awake the whole night, He continued to experience deep sorrow and remorse within himself. As the next morning dawned, it is said that he had the epiphany that moments of great sorrow have the potential for tremendous transformation, But for that transformation one has to go deep into the soul, Without blaming anyone, One has to endure it, without pitying oneself!",

        "card_content": "Some philosophers have divided the emergence of consciousness into three symbols: camel, lion and child. Camel is a four-legged draft animal. He is always ready to become a slave. He never creates trouble or betrays. He can never refuse. He is a faithful follower and a devoted servant or slave. Such consciousness is very rare in humans.\n\nThe lion is a symbol of change, Symbolizes transformation, And it is a symbol of revolution by turning upside down! Revolution or transformation begins with a sense of purity. The need for a person remains in the camel's consciousness, Who takes him and tells him 'you have to do this'. A camel needs ten types of commands. He needs all the religions, all the priests and all the religious texts, Because he does not trust himself. He lacks courage, his soul is dead, No longing for freedom, There is no excitement. He is always obedient.\n\nWhereas Leo loves his freedom. He always yearns for freedom. He has the desire to destroy every kind of prison and bondage. Leo does not need any leader. That is sufficient in itself. He cannot allow anyone to tell him, 'This is what you have to do.' It is insulting for Leo to do so. Only he can say that 'I will definitely do it.'\n\nBut a lion does not have the height at which a human is. Only then can he be at such a high peak, When one transforms oneself and feels like a child. A child is innocent. He is not obedient. But he doesn't disobey either. He is not a believer, but not a disbeliever either. He is pure and trustworthy. His eyes are pure and free from defects. It is sacred, acceptable, respected and liberated for the entire existence. Pride is man's self-respect. Pride is a man's false reputation. No one should consider it synonymous with self-respect. Ego takes away your self-respect or your importance, Takes away your majesty, Because ego depends on others, on others' thoughts and what people say. Ego is fleeting. People's intentions and thoughts can change and destroy the ego.\n\nWhen we feel like we are losing life, we start rejecting the demands of others. We separate ourselves from the crowd. After separating from the crowd, we become alone and proud. That is our truth and that is also the creativity of truth. In the end, there is awakening from somewhere inside us, there is neither any frustration nor any disappointment in the awakening that happens inside us. There is a complete awakening. If we allow that to happen, a new revolution will be born. If there is a revolution then change will definitely come.\n\nThe choice of the camel as a symbol symbolizes a lower level of consciousness, which is perhaps more appropriate. Minimal consciousness is a sign of man's paralysis, It likes slavery more. A person having such thinking remains afraid of fulfilling his responsibilities. A man with minimal consciousness is ignorant and unintelligent, has been inattentive and dormant, Because till now the burden of external knowledge has been kept on him. This burden of knowledge has been like a nectar of faith for that person, Loyalty and trust have been like poison, Symbolizes a commitment to never say 'no' to any command. The person who cannot say 'no' after hearing any command, loses his pride and self-respect. 'Yes' has no meaning for him. Only the one who is capable can say 'No'! Therefore, become a lion and not a camel. The camel has to be transformed into a lion, who likes to die, does not like the life of slavery. Saying 'yes' is contrary to his nature. A child neither knows anything about a camel nor about a lion! He is innocent, it is his nature to forget. There is purity and innocence in his 'yes'. He can with all probability say 'no'. He has no fear, he has complete trust.\n\nThis is the biggest transformation of man.",
        "card_description": "This card symbolizes the gradual emergence of consciousness. Some philosophers have divided the gradual development of consciousness into three symbols: camel, lion and child. Characteristics of these three symbols are present in humans.\n\nThe camel always remains drowsy, Remains dull and self-satisfied. He always lives in an illusion and thinks of himself as the top of the mountain, but he is so dependent on the opinions of others that he can muster up some courage with great difficulty. Something like a lion emerges from the camel. When we feel as if we are wasting or wasting life, we reject the demands of others, Let's say 'no'.\nBy now we have passed that crowd, All alone and proud... with the truth within me roaring like a lion. But life does not end here!\n\nUltimately there is a transformation in the child's appearance. There is neither any acceptance or consent nor any betrayal or disturbance in this process! Instead of all this, he is a symbol of innocence, free will, truth and simplicity. It is from here that you can transform yourself with your gradual emergence.",

When you feel sadness or sadness inside, anxiety and despair, when you feel as if the whole world is against you, From that moment you have to be careful. When you are surrounded by deep darkness all around, at that time you have to keep the light on, all these situations become helpful for you.\n\nI don't believe in what other people call meditation. You do it for ten minutes or twenty minutes. After this you fulfill your normal needs for 24 hours. After twenty-four hours you meditate again for twenty minutes. For me, meditation is like breathing. So whatever you are doing, whatever you are, do it with utmost awareness. For example, when you raise your hand, it does not require any consciousness. In that you do it according to your habit, But this action can be done with full awareness. You can feel the difference between a hand raised automatically and a hand raised with full awareness, While the action is the same! The first is habitual and the second is conscious. Try it and you will see that there is a huge difference between the two!\n\nYou try it, because it is a matter of experience. If you're walking, walk consciously for a few minutes, taking each step consciously, So you will be surprised that you will feel a huge difference between normal walking and conscious walking. Along with that you will also feel relaxed. Maintain alertness while eating. In a country like Ethiopia, thousands of people die of hunger every day, whereas in America people die after eating too much food. Those people, who are suffering due to obesity or obesity, also cannot stop eating more.\n\nNo doctor can cure their disease unless they can stop it themselves or become aware of it. If such people become aware and alert, their overeating will gradually reduce. Then they will start chewing and eating. Unless you do this, that is, if you do not chew your food, then you should understand that you are placing an unnecessary burden on your overall digestive system. There are no teeth in your stomach. A person should chew each morsel of food forty-two times. This cycle of life and death continues continuously. This life has not been found for the first time. We come from the unknown and go back into the unknown. Again and again this body dies and is born again and again, But our consciousness, which we know as the soul, never dies. The soul always remains immortal in our physical structure.",

Whatever skill you have within you, whatever experience you have gained in your life, express it yourself.\n\nThe basic fact of life is that unless you create something new or create something new, you will always experience sadness. Only creation can give you pride. The King of Fire tells us that whenever we receive or accept something, wisdom and maturity come within us.\n\nA real creator has no ambition. He is always mysterious and keeps creating himself. An example can be given here that a poet or painter is a true creator. He is not greedy for any fame or dominance.",

In general, during economic transactions in ordinary life, the more you share, the more you lose, But spiritual capital is such that the more you share with others, the more you receive. The more you share your love, the more it grows. The more people you share your happiness with, the more happiness arises within you. This happens only in spiritual economics, Not in physical economics.\n\nThere is an interesting story regarding this subject. A young man recently got a huge lottery prize. There was no limit to his happiness. He stopped his car at a place where a beggar was standing nearby. That beggar had been standing at the same place every day, but before that the young man had not stopped his car. Today everything had changed. The young man gave the beggar a hundred dollar currency and the beggar started laughing. The young man asked, 'I am not able to understand, Why are you laughing?' The beggar said, 'I remembered my past. Sometimes I also used to drive in my car and donate generously like you. That's why I'm laughing, Because soon you too will be seen standing next to me, So learn something from my experience, don't be so generous!' In ordinary economic dealings, the moment you give something away, you suffer a loss. But have you experienced a similar loss when you shared love and happiness with someone? Did you feel any lack of happiness and love? You distribute yourself among your friends. You will not find any shortcomings in yourself. On the contrary, you will get something extra.\n\nGive to anyone, share anything, there should be completeness in it. Don't hesitate in giving and don't keep anything back, learn from your own experience and not from the advice of others.",

There is no such thinking in his mind that he should make a list of things or save something, which will be useful later. She opens her entire treasure to distribute. She invites everyone to share her aura, her prosperity and her fruitfulness.\n\nWhen you draw this card, it indicates to you that you too have the right opportunity to share your love, free joy and happiness. When you share you will feel that you are more fulfilled and prosperous than before! Now you don't have to go anywhere else or set any specific goal. You will feel so fulfilled from within, that all your efforts will bring you heaps of joy and happiness. Whatever you do, you will feel complete satisfaction and joy. You will experience that limitless power of creativity within you, due to which even if you work on a new plan, it will require the same amount of creative power as giving birth to a child.",

Now you neither have to look backward nor forward! Whoever you are, wherever you are, Are in your present! The present is the only existence.\n\nPay attention - when you are in a state of intensity and completeness in a particular emotion, your selfishness disappears there. Suppose you are in love with someone. There is intensity and depth in your love, So in those moments your selfishness disappears. There you are alone, The same thing also applies to emotions like anger, hatred, lust etc. In such extreme moments, only your emotions like love, hatred, anger etc. remain there. Love becomes invisible in front of 'self' or 'selfishness'. Selfishness occurs only when your mind remains incomplete in any object or action. The feeling of incompleteness is your selfishness.\n\nIf you are completely engaged in painting, playing guitar, dancing, singing or any such art, at that time you will immediately feel that you are not there. There only your art practice remains. There must have been moments in your life when, knowingly or unknowingly, you were observing the beautiful view of the sunset and you forgot everything else and got engrossed in that view. At that moment you are no longer aware of your selfishness. At that time you are not present there and have gone somewhere else. At that time you become so united with existence that your ego of 'I' or 'self' no longer exists there. After this, whatever remains for you is the free experience of beauty, the experience of love, the experience of beautiful music. The experience of such moments is natural, which comes and disappears on its own.\n\nA small child always lives in 100 degrees. During that time his every activity is 100% complete. If he starts hating you, he hates you 100%, If he loves, he loves completely...! But in the next moment it changes completely. There is not even a moment's delay in changing his attitude. He changes so much in a moment that he doesn't worry about it at all! Just a moment ago he was sitting on your lap, trying to tell you how much he loves you! But then something like this happens, 'I' 'I will never come to you again'. At that time, look into the eyes of that child, then he has the same feeling of distance towards you.\n\nAdopt an approach of living each moment of life to the fullest, So that you don't have to carry the burden of memories of incompleteness throughout your life. When you live a fulfilling life, there will be a coordination of intensity in it and when it ends, you will not dream of getting it again, an overall fulfilling, satisfying and intense way of life can only give you the present, past or future! In other words, the present is your living and complete moment.",

He is fully aware of the direction in which he is travelling and that is why he is moving at a fast pace. Its intensity is based on the horizon of the sky and time. When you work with full intensity, it takes power to create ripples in the surrounding water. One feels as if your mere presence is creating waves. While others feel like a shock. It has its own perspective. Now you are in motion, no force can set you back.",

Fear of death, fear of life, fear of love etc. which have become fear for life automatically disappear. A man who has reached such a state never experiences any kind of burden. A person feels so light and energetic that he wishes to fly in the open sky.\n\nThe world's great philosopher Osho has presented before us a beautiful option for such a serious person.\n\nHere the word playing or game does not mean that in which the goal is fixed, if you are fond of playing football or you love football, then play football, Just keep playing, then you will reach a situation where there will be neither regret of victory nor regret of defeat.\n\nYou should consider your life as a game without expecting any result, just keep doing your work, when you travel with the weight of result or victory or defeat, only then will seriousness come upon you and it will feel like life.\n\nSuch serious humans have created this world. Only serious people have created all the religions of the world. Not only this, such serious people have created all the philosophical ideologies, cultures and all kinds of morals and have created a veil around existence, out of which serious people are created.\n\nOsho has ignored such a serious world. In return, he has presented to us a world which is full of playfulness, humor and joy and the great gurus have childlike innocence on their faces.",

At that time we had no worries that the ocean waves would come and engulf the sand castle. She knows that the whole life is a game, in which one has to continue playing her role without any worries.\n\nThe moment fire enters your life, you are ready to become completely new and fresh. Something wonderful appears on the horizon. Be ready to accept that amazingness with an open mind.",

You are not limited to any one possibility. The doors of unlimited possibilities are open to you, No restrictions. You can become anything, The next moment can bring you anything.\n\nA single person is the symbol of the entire humanity. Not only the entire humanity, the entire existence is contained in him. You are a unit of the entire existence of this universe. There is total existence within you. The tree exists within you, the dog exists and the tiger exists. Even if the past exists within you, the future also exists. This means that the possibilities of complete existence are within you!\n\nNature is the culmination of infinite possibilities. The result of these possibilities is that water automatically evaporates at a temperature of 100 degrees centigrade and again at zero temperature the same water gets converted into ice. These are all natural phenomena, which keep happening continuously. In the same way darkness is natural and light is also natural. If rising up is natural, falling down is also natural. What I mean to say is that there are infinite possibilities inherent in nature.\n\nWe always stand at a crossroads through which infinite paths emerge. Now the most important thing is which path we choose! Our ability to choose the path is a precious gift of nature! But the most important thing is which path we choose! Our ability to choose the right path is also a gift of nature. If you choose the path to hell, nature will not stop you, she will clear your path. If you choose the path to heaven, nature will not stop you, Will clear the way.\n\nAll possibilities are inherent in nature. Whether you want to die or live, nature will support you in every situation. The whole of life is nature. Dying is natural and living is also natural. It depends on your ability and interest whether you want to die or live. Possibilities remain in both cases. Man chooses his path in life from among the many possibilities, Because his consciousness is more developed. He chooses his path not only with his body but also with his mind. He wants to travel not only on earth but also in space. Both these paths depend on his power, what does he choose?\n\nThe path to all possibilities is open for human beings. If you are more conscious, your choices will lead to happiness. The choice of one who is completely unconscious will lead to difficulties and sorrows, Because possibilities remain in every aspect of an object.",

This card indicates that you are standing at a point where the path leads you to limitless possibilities, the reason being that you have evolved amidst intense feelings of love, It happened amidst the fullness of self. You can work easily with others. You are calm, self-centered and spontaneous, Therefore, the possibilities can be identified well. You have established an identity with nature. You have understood that existence has made available to you all the possibilities you need!",

Sit with a tree and do not consider yourself a man or a woman, feel yourself like a tree. While bathing in the river, do not consider yourself a human being but consider yourself a river. After this you will get lakhs of signals.\n\nWhen you see an object, look at it, Touch it, But don't think anything about it. You get a special feeling when seeing, hearing and touching, But as soon as you start thinking about it, all your feelings will disappear and as you think, you go into your personal world, your personal world. Thinking is related only to you. When you start thinking about something, at that time you are surrounded by a closed room in which the doors and windows remain closed, At that time you have your personal life, Feelings disappear.\n\nWhenever your eyes fall on an object, your mind starts interpreting it in its own way. Because at that time your mind is thinking something, Therefore, if something is said to you at such a time, you will not be able to hear it or will not be able to hear it properly. The true meaning of listening is to have your mind and heart open, Listen and accept it. Thinking is a positive action, whereas listening would be called negative.\n\nIf you can listen, then at that time nature says something, but the language of nature is not in words but in feelings. Nature does not use words, the language of nature is wordless. Nature uses signals, which can be felt. The smiling roses and their fragrance in the rose garden do not say anything! But their language has no words. The beauty of the moon frolicking among the stars and constellations on a full moon night cannot be recorded in words but in experiences.\n\nExistence has opened millions of doors for you, but you do not want to go inside them, You stand outside and try to get to know him.

The environment that surrounds us is delicately connected with us.\n\nThe woman shown in this card is not yet touching the tree, Right now he is in contact with the tree. At this time she has become one with the tree. That tree is very old and has been seen many times in difficult times. His touch is very gentlemanly and respectful and the cap on his head is white from inside, which is a symbol of his pure heart. He is humble, simple, and close to nature. When flowers bloom and spring arrives all around, nature does not express its joy by beating drums, And in autumn, when the leaves of the trees fall, nature does not mourn and wail.

Don't remain a mere observer. Today the entire modern world has become a mere spectator, a mere crowd of spectators!\n\nSome people dance, so you see it. What do you do? How do you see dance? Dance can only be felt, Dance can be done. When someone sings, you see and hear it. You have to dance to understand the song and appreciate its beauty. You will have to become its partner.\n\nYou keep crowding at the cinema windows for tickets, Why? To see the movie! Can't you live a beautiful life without watching movies? People watch TV in their homes. Stick to the chairs in front of the set, why? To see the lives of others and their lifestyle, whereas the truth is that the picture seen on the screen is not life, They are acting for you. You see those actors, not their real lives! everything is a lie,\n\nUnreal! To know the truth of something, participation in it is essential. The moment you consider it necessary to see something, to know it you become its participant, dancing and watching dance are two different situations. To know dance it is necessary to dance. How can you know what swimming is, While you are standing on the river bank just watching someone swimming! Standing on the shore, you can only see the slapping of the water and the person doing something in the water. But you will not know what is happening in the water to the person swimming, unless you feel it, unless you participate in the swim.

Will not ask anything like that. If there is any God, God or Supreme Soul, then he can only ask you whether you spent your life with happiness or with sorrow?\n\nThe entire existence is celebrating, so why are you standing alone, aloof and an observer?

I don't tell you, 'Do this...this is moral or don't do this, this is sinful...immoral...' Nothing like that. The only theme here is that whatever you do, complete it completely.\n\nTo understand the topic, take a step back, All I have to say here is that if you want to be angry at someone, express your total anger at that person, If you get something out of it, enjoy it. If you feel that doing so is stupid or crazy, then put it off and get yourself out of the situation.\n\nWhen you look back at some of the most common events in your life, you realize that you are fragmented and incomplete. Get completely absorbed in any 'such' activity, and see, while walking on some path, you will take it to the last point of perfection, which you have never experienced before! Then you start thinking 'I should have done it.' It was possible, it would have been nice if it had been done!'\n\nThis is how you start repenting. A feeling of guilt starts appearing in the mind. The main reason for this is incompleteness of work.

If you fail to complete that work, no matter how much time passes, you will never be able to get rid of the memories and regrets of the incompleteness of that work.\n\nThe man who is holistically aware knows that there was no possibility of doing the work much good, Then why remember him?

If you want to be successful, and by chance you become successful, So that will not make you complete, Because it all depends on your mind. The reason is that if you get what you want in life, it becomes meaningless to you later. After that our mind moves further, To get more than that... then even more than that... it means that our desires are infinite, She is never satisfied. What you get and your desire to get more, The distance between these two always remains.\n\nLook at the waves of the ocean. The higher it rises, the greater is the depth behind it. Similarly, in life, where one wave rises high, the other wave keeps on ending. That is, one moment in life is yours, and the next moment goes away from you. If you want to remain at the top in life, it is never possible. One moment is of success, the other moment is of failure. You can make your life balanced, but the condition is that you should not be addicted to success. Just as you celebrate success, celebrate failure in the same way.\n\nWhat this means is that if a person fails in life, then the seeds of his success are sown in that failure itself. Therefore, enjoy life by maintaining a balance between success and failure.\n\nTherefore, if you want to be successful, you can get success, but you cannot remain stable on that success. Then what is the meaning of that success, if after achieving it you do not become stable, determined and satisfied? If the circumstances for you are in accordance with your mentality and due to that, you can also be successful. But mostly the possibility of failure remains. The reason for that is that you are not the only one chasing success! Crores of people chase the same success. Out of one billion people in a country, many people want to become the Prime Minister, but only one person will be successful, right?\n\nIf you fail in your objective, you sink into despair, At that time you start feeling that your life is completely over. Success and failure, Then success and failure, This is the game of life. If there remains a lot of distance between success and you, So you look for a new way to get closer to success, Even in that, if we are not able to achieve success, Then a new way to succeed! This sequence continues, but the distance between your desires and their satisfaction never ends.\n\nMan found another way to escape the cycle of success and failure, Which leads to monasteries and ashrams. They want to escape from the worldly world of struggles, successes and failures, where they have to face competition at every step. They want to hide in a place where there is no stimulation, Nor any temptation! They just want to live comfortably within themselves in such a place. They do not desire success, One kind of his new desire is spiritual success! This is a new trick of his.\n\nA very beautiful way to get rid of the conflict between success and failure is to enjoy both. The joy of failure? Yes, suppose you go somewhere, enjoy whatever is available there. If there is success, enjoy it, If there is failure, you will get a different kind of joy in that success, which cannot be found in failure.\n\nA person who is absolutely healthy enjoys his health, But if he falls ill, he also enjoys his illness while lying in bed. How is that?\n\nHe lies comfortably on the bed, doing nothing. He has no worries about worldly matters. Every person in the family takes every possible care of his comfort.

All the events related to existence keep happening automatically, There is no need for any struggle or any effort for them.\n\nA rich man has everything, as much as he is capable of. Still, deep inside his mind, the same thought keeps roaming that he has nothing. Due to this thinking, he always experiences stress, disappointment, anxiety and mental disturbance. All these factors make that rich person even poorer than the ordinary poor. The reason for this is that the hopes of a poor person are always alive, That's why he is not that poor. He always lives with the hope that one day his luck will open and blessings will be showered on him.\n\nOn the contrary, a rich person has already reached where he wanted to reach. His hopes remain fulfilled. But suddenly he now realizes that nothing is perfect. Despite all his hopes being fulfilled, he continues to feel incomplete. Such a person keeps wandering in a dreamland, away from reality.\n\nIn fact, when everything remains outside, there remains a permanent difference. As a result, the feeling becomes strong in your mind that you are empty inside, you have nothing. Such a situation echoes the poverty and destitution within you.

It is equally true that sometimes there will be sadness and sometimes happiness in your life. Remember, happiness and sorrow are options of the mind. Accept it and enjoy a stress free life.",
        "card_description": "Are you aware that there are so many people who live with the burden of so many tasks simultaneously? Due to which there is an excessive burden on them, Burdened beyond their capacity! It is like throwing many balls in the air and trying to catch them in both your hands.\n\nThus carrying the burden of many tasks, if you suddenly become a victim of high fever, or fall down due to prolonged fatigue, then everything is lost for you. That time or that moment will be considered very unfortunate for you. But that is the eternal truth of life. Incidents keep happening. You can't stop them. The cycle of resolutions and options keeps rotating in the journey of life. But the very attempt to stop or disrupt it becomes a permanent cause of our stress. Our stress does not come from anywhere, we are the only reason for its creation. Can you imagine that the sun will not rise until you set the alarm? Everything continues the same. All you have to do is remain stress-free by keeping yourself separate from that dynamic cycle of events.",

There is no end to it. Where there is a pause, Where the destination of life, the ultimate goal of life is found, Where life's journey comes to a halt, That is death!\n\nThere is no destination in the journey of life. Life is a continuous journey. Your entire life is a journey! This journey has been going on for thousands of years. Suppose you reach your ultimate goal? Have you ever considered this possibility? Suppose you suddenly meet God? At that time you have no words to say to God, and God also has nothing to say!\n\nThis is the end result of your life journey till now. This is the final result of your journey i.e. death. Everything is over! You burnt yourself out unnecessarily. There is no final destination anywhere, And even if such confusion exists, it has no value! Whatever is found in the journey of life, what is its value, what is its quality, Don't ask it. Enjoy every moment, everything. Be it a pilgrimage or a country trip, know this well that there is no end to the journey of life! Enjoy the journey. The journey will continue, the flow of life will always be dynamic. There is no place where the path ends!",
        "card_description": "The small figure seen in the card is moving forward on the beautiful earth, but where is its destination? She has no idea what point she wants to reach! All he knows is that his goal is to continue on the journey and the pilgrimage site is a sacred place in itself. Every step taken on the journey of life is important. Whenever this card is studied, it will clearly indicate that this is the time for change and mobility. Mobility involves traveling from one place to another, Then from there the journey to the next destination! Apart from this, there can also be internal mobility, sometimes here and sometimes there!\n\nWhatever be the problem, this card definitely assures that your journey will be smooth and simple and will also provide you with bold opportunities for growth. In this you do not need to struggle or make any additional arrangements. This travel card also reminds us to accept and welcome whatever new comes in the journey of life. Just like when we travel to another country, where the culture and environment is different, But later we get used to it. In the same way, always have a receptive and accepting approach in the journey of life. Invite new experiences and new friends into your life.",

When you become neutral by moving away from the events happening around you, you see that there are millions and billions of events happening in this entire existence, which you cannot even count. It is not that these events are happening right now, These have already been happening, but you have not noticed them till now. The reason for this is that you were busy in achieving other tasks and objectives, that is why you never paid attention to them. While the birds continue to sing, their chirping continues as before, but you remain untouched by it! Trees and plants continue to flourish and flourish in the same way. The scheduled events of creation continue to happen as before.\n\nYou have to come out of this situation. You have to break free from the grip of busyness. Where does your path lead? There is always only one thought roaming in your mind that in the future you may reach some goal. But the question arises that your life is here, then why are you waiting for the future instead of thinking about the present? Why do you ruin your present in hopes of the future? This is very suicidal for you.\n\nThe pace of life is very slow. Why don't you feel it? Looks like you are unconscious, otherwise postponing your present activities and leaving it to the future is suicidal for you. Whatever is in front of you in life, complete it right now, Don't leave it for tomorrow or the future. As easy and simple as it is to become active, it is equally easy to become inactive. There are millions and crores of people on this earth who are constantly active, dynamic, always active day and night without stopping, they neither have time to rest nor to take a break. A kind of impatience or restlessness persists in them. That is why they keep changing their attitudes. It is not possible for them to sit idle. They are always trying to achieve something or the other and keeping themselves busy in the same. In a way their life remains turbulent and restless. Due to their constant busyness, they gradually drag themselves towards madness.\n\nBe active, make circumstances favorable to you, But don't be restless and anxious. When your activity is complete, in which you have endured much disturbance, After that you take complete rest. Do the most work at the time when you are busy with some work, While you are playing, keep playing, while you are resting, keep worldly problems aside and take complete rest, Forget the whole world.",

In an effort to fulfill all his aspirations simultaneously, this person kept his entire life imprisoned in the chamber of busyness and what is the importance of comfort in life? Or is it relaxing? Couldn't understand it.\n\nThe message of this card is not just about talking or building castles in the air. This card shows ways for us to become perfect and secure. But their path is uncomfortable and unnatural. We created those paths and spent our entire lives busy trying to operate them as per our wish and achieve success.\n\nWe have forgotten that the events of the entire creation, the entire existence keep happening automatically. They cannot be stopped or diverted. Don't make life a time table, Feel free to walk among the roses… enjoy the mountain beauty and music, the whole existence is with you!",

        "card_content": "Whenever there is a hindrance in the flow of life, wherever there is a hindrance, the strings of the mind get scattered, Thoughts get scattered. Whatever you accept, or accept, is in the conscious state, whatever you reject, goes into the unconscious. This happens only when there is too much pressure and obstruction on your mind. The social garbage which the society has rejected is what you are unconsciously going to throw on others. But in doing so you must remember that whatever you reject, Even if you throw it away, it becomes a strong part of your life. In this conflict of mind, you start the process of repression by rejecting conscious thoughts and its adverse effects remain permanent in the unconscious.\n\nContinuously suppressing thoughts can create a dangerous situation! Psychologists say that eighty percent of human diseases originate from suppression of emotions. Who knows, many incidents of cardiac arrest occur due to continuous suppression of anger. By continuously suppressing the feeling of hatred the heart becomes poisonous. The way to transform the impulse of emotions is different.\n\nIn the process of controlling the emotions, you block their speed by putting pressure on them, While in the process of transformation the emotions are expressed and made clear, the flow of emotions is not blocked. But keep one thing in mind that do not vent your emotions on anyone else. If you do this, the consequences can be fatal for you. On any other occasion, if an emotional state of anger arises inside you, the way to transform it is to walk away from there and circumambulate the house seven times. After that, sit under a tree and enjoy the beauty of nature. Where has the anger gone now?\n\nYou did not try to suppress your anger nor did you try to control it. You did not even try to vent your anger on anyone else. If you try to throw or vent your anger on another person, a chain will be formed from there. The reason for this is that if the person on whom you are venting your anger turns out to be as foolish as you and as unconscious as you, then a revolving chain will start from there, The result of which will be that your inner self will become anxious, frustrated, disturbed and stressed, which can cause serious diseases. If you make the foolish mistake of venting out your anger on someone else and that person turns out to be as foolish as you, then in response that person will vent out even more anger on you. The result will be the creation of enmity, The end of which becomes difficult. How terrible anger is for us, but generally people are not fully aware of its ill effects. You don't need to vent your anger on anyone else, It is better to go straight to the bathroom than to vent your anger on someone else, Go for a long walk somewhere, You will find that inner activity can bring you back to normal by transforming your emotions. To avoid the disaster of anger, you do not need to suppress, control or block your emotions or feelings.\n\nYou do not need any special caution or awareness to control your anger. You need to be intuitively mindful, so that process becomes your nature. Then you will not need any pressure or repression to control the flood of your emotions. Society keeps imposing control on every step, society never teaches you to be aware or awake every moment of life. The reason is clear – an awakened person has a broader perspective. Through narrow-mindedness he keeps himself aloof. On the contrary, it becomes a permanent mentality of a person who strictly controls his emotions or feelings. Society suggests various types of controls on such people. Society advises you to stay locked in a cave, In which there is no hole to peek out!\n\nRemember one thing here when nothing can go out from inside you, Neither can anything come in from outside, You have closed yourself off in this way, So in such a situation no beauty from outside can touch you. The eyes cannot perceive beauty. In a way you are living in an emotional state. In a way, you are bearing the brunt of the unconscious state and all this is the bad result of suppressing anger and forceful control. Your consciousness develops along with your awareness. If you repress, control and inhibit your emotions, So such a life, while alive, is like a dead one.",
        "card_description": "The figure seen in the card is literally indicating that everything in it is blocked in tied knots. Yet his own light still shines within him. But that figure has tied its vitality in knots and wants many expectations to be fulfilled at the same time. The figure has given up its overall strength, Suspended all viewpoints, So that by gaining more and more power he can suppress the explosive power within himself. By blocking or suppressing the emotions, a power gradually gets blocked, whose explosion can be extremely frightening!\n\nThe only message of this card is to seek some solace from outside before the power within you explodes! It is also necessary to find its solution, so that the way to transform the tension or unrest which is becoming explosive inside you can be found in time. To get relief from your anger, stress or anxiety, you can use your explosive power. You can transform yourself by hitting the pillow, running in the garden or circling the house, for that you do not need to get into trouble with anyone!",

The whole society forces you to spend all your energy on your mind. The endeavor to make the mind the basis of every type of education is continuing and the argument is that the vibration of overall power is based on the mind only, mathematicians, engineers, doctors etc. are born from sharp minds or powerful minds only.\n\nBut, according to the opinion of philosophers and psychoanalysts, come out of the power of the mind and recognize the source of power within you, from where all kinds of educational tendencies get their strength. This is the same power from which the whole world derives educational energy, brain energy, power of thoughts, imaginative power and thinking power. The brain uses these powers. If you use the total energy only through your mind, you will not experience the power and self-awareness inherent within you.\n\nThat power is always present within you, that power keeps throbbing in the middle of your body. Keeps pulsating. This power does not move anywhere else, Neither in the mind, nor in the heart! The source of this power is so sufficient that all the organs of the body receive power from there. There is immense energy contained in this power. It can be transformed towards light, it can be transformed towards love, Can be transformed towards kindness and creativity. This power can take many shapes, But first you have to learn how to access that power source. When you need brain power, let that power flow to the brain, If love is needed, then let it flow towards the heart.\n\nRemember one more thing, you do not have to keep thinking twenty-four hours continuously. When you stop thinking, you discover unlimited power and adaptability. The glow of that power source is within you, Not outside you. If you search for it outside, your search will be in vain. Close your eyes and go within yourself. Enlighten yourself with the immense source of your inherent strength.",

Whenever we start any activity, we channel the same source into our creativity. But this is possible only when we come in contact with that source by being completely calm and meditative.\n\nThis power source is within all of us. This power is just like the Sun nourishes us personally by giving us light and energy and makes our life a storehouse of power. There is a pure energy source present within us, whose heartbeat we keep feeling. With that power we can achieve anything. Whether we are active or wish to rest, that power always welcomes us. You don't need to step out of the circle, take two steps forward and search anywhere.",

'પ્રેમ' એટલે પ્રેમની પૃષ્ઠભૂમિમાં એક પ્રકારનો લોભ છુપાયેલો છે, જ્યારે સાચી મિત્રતામાં એકબીજા માટે ત્યાગ કે કંઈક આપવાની લાગણી હોય છે.\n\nમિત્રતામાં સાચા અર્થમાં મિત્રતાનો અહેસાસ હોય છે એટલે કે કોઈ પણ અપેક્ષા વગર બીજા (મિત્ર)ને બધું જ આપી દેવું. તમારી દરેક ખુશી, દરેક દુ:ખ અને દરેક આરામ આપવા તૈયાર રહેવું અને જે કોઈ પણ અપેક્ષા વગર કૃતજ્ઞતાપૂર્વક સ્વીકારે છે તે મિત્ર છે. મિત્રતા અને મિત્રતા! અહીં એકબીજાની જરૂરિયાતનો પ્રશ્ન જ નથી. અહીં કોઈ પ્રશ્ન નથી કે જ્યારે તમે કોઈ સંકટમાં પડી જાઓ છો, ત્યારે તમારા મિત્રો તમને બચાવવા દોડી આવે છે! તે આવી શકે તે સંપૂર્ણપણે અસંગત છે, આવી પણ ન શકે! પરંતુ યાદ રાખો, જો તે ન આવે, તો તમારે તેની ફરિયાદ ન કરવી જોઈએ. જો તે આવે, તો તમે આભારી છો, જો તે ન આવે તો પણ આભાર! \n\nમિત્રતા એક મહાન કલા છે, 'કલા' છે, મિત્રતામાં કોઈ ચોક્કસ વ્યક્તિ હોતી નથી, જેને આપણે ખાસ કરીને મિત્ર કહી શકીએ! મિત્રતામાં એવું નથી થતું કે તમે અમુક ખાસ કે અમુક લોકો સાથે જ મિત્રતા જાળવી રાખો. જો તમારો વિચાર આવો હોય તો સમજી લેવું કે એ તમારો નાડો અને ભ્રષ્ટ વિચાર છે. મિત્રતા સ્થાપિત કરવાને બદલે, દરેક સાથે મૈત્રીપૂર્ણ રહેવું વધુ સારું છે. મિત્રતાનો અહેસાસ તમારો એક વિશેષ ગુણ અથવા તમારા વ્યક્તિત્વની ઓળખ બનવો જોઈએ.\n\nસમગ્ર અસ્તિત્વનો પરસ્પર સંબંધ મૈત્રીપૂર્ણ હોવો જોઈએ. જો તમને અસ્તિત્વ સાથે મિત્રતાની ભાવના હોય, પછી અસ્તિત્વ તમારા પર મિત્રતાની હજાર ગણી લાગણી વરસાવશે. જો તમે અસ્તિત્વ તરફ ફૂલો ફેંકશો, તો અસ્તિત્વ તમને બદલામાં અસંખ્ય ફૂલોથી આવરી લેશે. મિત્રતા એ જીવનનો અરીસો છે. તમારો ચહેરો અરીસામાં પ્રતિબિંબિત થાય છે. મિત્રતાની ભાવના રાખો. તમારું આખું જીવન મિત્રતાની લાગણીથી ભરાઈ જશે!

'હા' કહેવું તેના સ્વભાવની વિરુદ્ધ છે. બાળક ન તો ઊંટ વિશે કશું જાણતું હોય છે કે ન તો સિંહ વિશે! તે નિર્દોષ છે, ભૂલી જવું તેનો સ્વભાવ છે. તેની 'હા'માં શુદ્ધતા અને નિર્દોષતા છે. તે તમામ સંભાવના સાથે 'ના' કહી શકે છે. તેને કોઈ ડર નથી, તેને સંપૂર્ણ વિશ્વાસ છે.\n\nઆ માણસનું સૌથી મોટું પરિવર્તન છે.",

        "card_content": "इन तीन बातों को स्मरण रखिए- प्रेम की तीन अवस्थाएँ हैं। सबसे निम्न स्तर का प्रेम 'सेक्स' है, जो शारीरिक होता है। प्रेम का शुद्ध और सर्वोच्च स्तर 'करुणा' है। अतः 'सेक्स' प्रेम से नीचे है और करुणा प्रेम के ऊपर है। इन दोनों (सेक्स और करुणा) के बीच की स्थिति प्रेम है। बहुत कम लोग जानते हैं कि प्रेम वास्तव में है क्या? दूसरों की दृष्टि में प्रेम पागलपन है। यह ऐसे लोगों का दृष्टिकोण है, जो यह जानते ही नहीं कि प्रेम है क्या ! सौ व्यक्तियों में से निन्यानवे व्यक्ति दुर्भाग्यवश यही सोचते हैं कि सेक्स संबंध ही प्रेम है, परन्तु ऐसा नहीं है। सेक्सुअल आनंद तो पशुता से भरा होता है। यद्यपि उसमें से प्रेम विकसित हो सकता है, परन्तु वह प्रेम नहीं है।\r\n\r\nसेक्सुअल आनंद को प्रेम में परिवर्तित किया जा सकता है  परन्तु उसके लिए आपको जागृत और सावधान बनना होगा  गहरे ध्यान में डूबकर मेडिटेटिव बनना होगा। जब आपका प्रगाढ़पन शुद्ध और पवित्र बन जाए, तो आप महसूस करेंगे कि वही प्रेम, करुणा में परिवर्तित हो जाता है। भौतिक आनंद प्राप्त करने हेतु, भौतिक सौंदर्य पर आधारित प्रेम क्षणिक और पाशविक होता है, स्थायी नहीं होता। सेक्स बीज के समान है  जिसमें विकसित पौधे में लगा पुष्प प्रेम के समान है। प्रेम पुष्प से फैलती सुवास रुपी करुणा है ! \r\n\r\nबुद्ध ने करुणा की व्याख्या करते हुए कहा है- “प्रेम और ध्यान का योग करुणा है।” जब आपका प्रेम किसी से कोई इच्छा न रखे  जब आपका प्रेम केवल आवश्यकता अथवा स्वार्थ न रह जाए  जब आपका प्रेम दूसरों को बाँटने के लिए हो  जब आपका प्रेम भिखारी नहीं, राजा हो, सम्राट हो  जब आपका प्रेम बदले में कुछ मांगता न हो  इसके बजाय सबकुछ दूसरों को देने के लिए तैयार हो, अपने अंतर्मन की खुशियाँ दूसरों को बाँटकर आनंद मिल रहा हो, उस समय आप अपने प्रेम में 'ध्यान' (Meditation) को शामिल कर लीजिए। आप महसूस करेंगे कि उसमें से जो दिव्य सुगंध  फैलती है। वही करुणा है, एक अद्भुत वस्तु करुणा ! \r\n\r\nप्रेम की सुवास करुणा के रूप में फैलती है  परन्तु ऐसे प्रेम में आत्मीयता का होना आवश्यक है। आत्मीयता वहीं होती है, जहाँ घनिष्ठता हो। घनिष्ठ एवं आत्मीय लगाव जहाँ होता है, वहाँ हम दूसरों को अपने अंतर्मन में झांकने की अनुमति देते हैं, जिससे वे हमारे हृदय की गहराई में उतर कर हमें जानने का प्रयास करें। आधुनिक युग में आत्मीयता धीरे-धीरे गायब होती जा रही है  इसका कारण यह है कि व्यक्ति के हृदय में ऐसा कुछ भी नहीं होता, जिसे वह दूसरों को बाँट सके। ऐसे हृदय में प्रेम नहीं, विकार और अहंकार होता है। प्रेम, जीवन-यात्रा का एक मात्र लक्ष्य है। एक बार आपका लक्ष्य स्पष्ट हो जाए, फिर आपकी आंतरिक सम्पन्नता विकसित होने लगेगी। हृदय के सारे ज़ख्म कमल बन कर खिल उठेंगे। प्रेम का यही रहस्य है और यही प्रेम का जादू है। प्रेम संसार का सबसे शक्तिशाली रसायन है। जो व्यक्ति प्रेमरूपी रसायन का प्रयोग करना जानता है, वह कामयाबी के शिखर पर पहुँच जाता है।",
        "card_description": "जिसे हम प्रेम कहते हैं, वह वास्तव में सम्बन्धों का जाल है। मेघधनुष की भाँति जो पृथ्वी से आकाश तक परावर्तित होता रहता है। भौतिक स्तर पर देखें तो प्रेम एक जातीय आकर्षण है। हममें से अधिकतर लोगों का प्रेम इसी स्तर का है। इसका कारण यह है कि हमारी परिस्थितियों और अपेक्षाओं के बोझ तले हमारी जातीय तरंगे (Sexual attraction) दमित होती रहती हैं। जो प्रेम जातीय (Sexual) आकर्षण पर आधारित हो, उसका कभी अंत ही नहीं होता। ऐसे प्रेम की यह सबसे बड़ी समस्या है। यदि हम इस वास्तविकता को स्वीकार कर लें, तो सचमुच में हम सेक्सुअल प्रेम का आनंद उठा सकते हैं  जिस के लिए वह है ! और जब वह न हो, तो कृतज्ञतापूर्वक अलविदा कह दीजिए।\r\n\r\nजब हम इस प्रक्रिया से अभ्यस्त और परिपक्व हो जाएँ, तो ऐसे प्रेम का अनुभव लेना हम शुरु कर सकते हैं। ऐसा प्रेम, जो जातीय आकर्षण (सेक्सुआलिटी) से बाहर अपना अस्तित्व रखता है  ऐसा प्रेम, जो समग्र ब्रह्माण्ड में एक-दूसरे के लिए आत्मसम्मान से भरा होता है। धीरे धीरे हम यह समझना शुरु कर देते हैं कि हमारा साथी प्रायः आइने की तरह कार्य सम्पादित करता है, जो हमारे भीतर की भावनाओं का गहरा प्रतिबिम्ब प्रकट करता है। इस तरह के प्रेम में कोई अपेक्षा अथवा स्वार्थ नहीं होता, आवश्यकताएँ नहीं होती, ऐसा प्रेम पूरी तरह स्वतंत्र होता है। उसके पंख हमें इस ब्रह्माण्ड के उस पार ले जाकर प्रेमी के साथ एक होने का अनुभव कराते हैं। ",

' अथवा 'ओफ ! बहुत बदसूरत ! ' यद्यपि ऐसा करने में आपका दिमाग असहज महसूस करेगा। परन्तु आप सहजरूप से दिमाग को अलग रखिए। धीरे धीरे सत्य को परखने की आपकी क्षमता में वृद्धि होगी।",

        "card_content": "किसी तत्वज्ञानी ने चेतना के आविर्भाव को तीन प्रतीकों में बाँट रखा है ऊँट, सिंह और बच्चा। ऊँट चार पैरों वाला भारवाहक एक जानवर है। वह सदैव गुलाम बनने के लिए तैयार रहता है। वह कभी उपद्रव अथवा द्रोह नहीं करता। वह कभी इन्कार नहीं कर सकता। वह विश्वासी अनुसरण करनेवाला और स्वामिभक्त दास अथवा गुलाम है। मनुष्य में ऐसी चेतना बहुत कम होती है।\r\n\r\nसिंह परिवर्तन का प्रतीक है  रूपांतरण का प्रतीक है  और उलटफेर करके क्रान्ति का प्रतीक है ! क्रान्ति का प्रारम्भ अथवा रूपान्तर की शुरुआत पवित्रभाव से होता हैं। ऊंट की चेतना में एक व्यक्ति की ज़रूरत बनी रहती है  जो उसे ले जाए और उसे कहे कि 'तुम्हें इसे करना होगा'। ऊंट को दस तरह की आज्ञाओं की ज़रूरत होती है। उसे सभी धर्मों, सभी पुजारियों पादरियों और सभी धार्मिक ग्रन्थों की आवश्यकता होती है  क्योंकि उसे स्वयं पर भरोसा नहीं रहता। उसमें साहस का अभाव है, उसकी आत्मा मर चुकी होती है  आज़ादी के लिए कोई लालसा नहीं  कोई उत्कंठा नहीं है। वह सदैव आज्ञाकारी होता है।\r\n\r\nजब कि सिंह को उसकी आज़ादी प्रिय है। उसे सदैव आज़ादी की उत्कंठा रहती है। उसके पास हर प्रकार के कैद और बंधनों को नष्ट कर देने की इच्छा रहती है। सिंह को किसी लीडर अथवा नेता की ज़रूरत नहीं होती। वह अपने आप में पर्याप्त है। वह इस बात की अनुमति किसी को भी नहीं दे सकता कि कोई उसे कहे, 'यह तुम्हें करना होगा।' ऐसा करना सिंह के लिए अपमानजनक है। ऐसा वही कह सकता है कि 'मैं अवश्य करूँगा।' \r\n\r\nपरन्तु सिंह के पास वह ऊँचाई नहीं होती, जिस उच्च शिखर पर मनुष्य होता है। उतने उच्च शिखर पर वह तभी हो सकता है  जब स्वतः का रूपांतरण करके एक बच्चे जैसा अनुभव करे। एक बच्चा निर्दोष होता है। वह आज्ञाकारी नहीं होता। परन्तु अवज्ञा भी नहीं करता। वह विश्वासी नहीं, परन्तु अविश्वासी भी नहीं। वह पवित्र भरोसेमंद होता है। उसकी आँखें विकाररहित पवित्र और पावन होती हैं। समग्र अस्तित्व के लिए वह पवित्र, ग्राह्य, सम्मानित और उत्मुक्त होता है। अभिमान मनुष्य का आत्मगौरव है। अभिमान मनुष्य की झूठी प्रतिष्ठा है। किसी को भी इसे आत्मगौरव का समानार्थी नहीं समझना चाहिए। अहंकार आपके आत्मगौरव अथवा आपकी महत्ता को छीन लेता है  आपके प्रताप का हरण कर लेता है  क्योंकि अहंकार दूसरों पर निर्भर रहता है, दूसरों के विचारों पर और लोगों के कहने पर निर्भर है। अहंकार क्षण भंगुर होता है। लोगों का मंतव्य और उनका विचार अहंकार को परिवर्तित और नष्ट कर सकता है।\r\n\r\nजब हमें ऐसा लगता है कि जीवन को खो रहे हैं, तो उस समय हम दूसरों की माँगों को नकारना शुरु कर देते हैं। हम स्वयं को भीड़ से अलग कर लेते हैं। भीड़ से अलग होने के बाद हम अकेले और गर्व से सम्पन्न हो जाते हैं। वही हमारा सत्य हैं और वही सत्य की सृजनात्मकता भी है। अंत में हमारे अंदर कहीं से जागृति होती है, हमारे अंदर जो जागृति होती है, उसमें न तो कोई हताशा होती है, न ही कोई निराशा। एक सम्पूर्ण जागृति होती है। यदि हम उसे होने देंगे, तो एक नयी क्रान्ति का जन्म होगा। यदि क्रान्ति होगी तो परिवर्तन अवश्य आएगा।\r\n\r\nप्रतीक के रूप में ऊँट का चुनाव एक निम्न कोटि की चैतन्यता का प्रतीक है, जो संभवतः अधिक उपयुक्त है। न्यूनतम चैतन्यता मनुष्य की पंगुता का परिचायक हैं  इसे दासता अधिक पसंद है। ऐसी सोच रखनेवाला मनुष्य अपनी ज़िम्मेदारियों को पूरा करने में भयभीत रहता है। न्यूनतम चेतनावाला मनुष्य अज्ञानी और बुद्धिहीन होता है  असावधान और सुषुप्तावस्था में रहा है  क्योंकि अब तक उस पर बाहरी ज्ञान का बोझ रखा जाता रहा है। यह ज्ञानरूपी बोझ उस व्यक्ति के लिए विश्वासरूपी अमृत सदृश्य रहा है  निष्ठा एवं भरोसारूपी विष के समान रहा है  किसी आज्ञा को 'ना' नहीं कहने की प्रतिबद्धता का प्रतीक है। जो व्यक्ति किसी आज्ञा को सुनकर 'ना' नहीं कह सकता, वह अपने गौरव तथा आत्मसम्मान को खो देता है। उसके लिए 'हाँ' का कोई अर्थ ही नहीं। 'ना' वही कह सकता है, जो सक्षम हो! अतः भारवाहक ऊँट नहीं, सिंह बनो। ऊंट को सिंह में रूपांतरित कर देना है, जो मर जाना पसंद करता है, दासता की ज़िन्दगी उसे नहीं पसंद है। 'हाँ' कहना उसकी प्रकृति के विपरीत है। एक बच्चा न तो ऊँट के बारे में कुछ जानता है, न ही सिंह के बारे में ! वह निर्दोष है, भूल जाना उसकी प्रकृति है। उसकी 'हाँ' में शुद्धता और निर्दोषता है। वह पूरी संभावना के साथ 'ना' कह सकता है। उसे कोई भय नहीं, वह पूर्णतः भरोसा रखता है।\r\n\r\nमनुष्य का यह सबसे बड़ा रूपांतरण है।",
        "card_description": "यह कार्ड चेतना के क्रमिक आविर्भाव को शब्दांकित करता है। किसी तत्त्वज्ञानी ने चैतन्यता के क्रमिक विकास को तीन प्रतीकों में विभक्त किया है ऊँट, सिंह और बच्चा। मनुष्य के अंदर इन तीनों प्रतीकों के लक्षण विद्यमान होते हैं।\r\n\r\nऊँट सदैव निद्राग्रस्त सा रहता है  जड़बुद्धि और आत्मसंतुष्ट रहता है। वह हमेशा भ्रमजाल में जीता है और वह स्वयं को पहाड़ की चोटी समझता है, लेकिन वह दूसरों की राय पर इतना निर्भर रहता है कि बड़ी कठिनाई से स्वयं में कुछ साहस इकट्ठा कर सकता है। ऊँट में से सिंह का कुछ आविर्भाव होता है। जब हम ऐसा महसूस करते हैं कि हम जीवन को व्यर्थ में गँवा रहे हैं, अथवा व्यर्थ में नष्ट कर रहे हैं, तो दूसरों की माँगों को हम नकार देते हैं  'ना' कह देते हैं।\r\nअब तक हम उस भीड़ से निकल चुके होते हैं  बिल्कुल अकेले और गर्व से. . .  अपने अंदर के सत्य को सिंह की भाँति दहाड़ते हुए। परन्तु जीवन का यहीं अंत नहीं है! \r\n\r\nअन्ततः बच्चे के स्वरूप में रूपांतरण होता है। इस प्रक्रिया में न तो कोई स्वीकार अथवा सहमति होती है न ही कोई द्रोह अथवा उपद्रव! इन सबके बजाय वह निर्दोषता, स्वेच्छाचारिता, सत्य एवं सरलता का प्रतीक है। यहीं से आप अपने क्रमिक आविर्भाव के साथ स्वयं का रूपांतरणकर सकते हैं।",

        "card_content": "आपको यदि कहा जाए कि ‘अंदर की तरफ जाओ' तो इसका सीधा अर्थ यही हुआ कि चैतन्य की ओर झाँको, मन के अंदर ढूंढों  न कि दिमाग से ढूंढो! पूरा समाज आपको दिमाग पर समग्र शक्ति को व्यय करने को बाध्य करता है। हर प्रकार की शिक्षा का आधार दिमाग को बनाने का उपक्रम जारी है और तर्क यही दिया जाता है कि समग्र शक्ति का स्पंदन दिमाग पर ही आधारित है, गणितज्ञ, इन्जीनियर, डॉक्टर आदि तेज़ दिमाग अथवा शक्तिशाली दिमाग से ही उत्पन्न होते हैं।\r\n\r\nपरन्तु, दार्शनिकों और मनोविश्लेषकों के मतानुसार दिमाग की शक्ति से बाहर आकर, अंदर की अपनी उस शक्ति स्त्रोत को पहचानों, जहाँ से हर प्रकार की शैक्षिक प्रवृत्तियाँ शक्ति प्राप्त करती हैं। यह वही शक्ति है, जिसे पूरा विश्व शैक्षणिक ऊर्जा, मस्तिष्क की ऊर्जा, विचारों की शक्ति, कल्पनात्मक शक्ति एवं चिन्तन शक्ति प्राप्त करता है। दिमाग इन्हीं शक्तियों का प्रयोग करता है। यदि समग्र ऊर्जा का उपयोग केवल दिमाग से ही करेंगे, तो आपको अपने भीतर निहित शक्ति एवं स्वयं की जागरूकता का अनुभव नहीं होगा।\r\n\r\nआपके अंदर वह शक्ति हमेशा मौजूद है, आपके शरीर के मध्य वह शक्ति धड़कती रहती है। स्पंदन करती रहती है। यह शक्ति कहीं अन्यत्र नहीं गतिशील होती  न तो दिमाग में, न ही हृदय में ! इस शक्ति का स्रोत इतना पर्याप्त है कि वहीं से शरीर के सभी अवयव शक्ति ग्रहण करते हैं। इस शक्ति में विशाल ऊर्जा निहित है। इसे प्रकाश की ओर रूपांतरित किया जा सकता है, प्रेम की ओर रूपांतरण हो सकता है  दयालुता और सृजन की ओर रूपांतरित की जा सकती है। यह शक्ति कई आकार ग्रहण कर सकती है  परन्तु सर्वप्रथम आपको यह सीखना है कि किस तरह आप उस शक्ति स्रोत तक पहुँच सकते हैं। जब आपको दिमाग की शक्ति की ज़रूरत हो, तो वह शक्ति दिमाग की ओर प्रवाहति करें  प्रेम की ज़रूरत है, तो हृदय की तरफ प्रवाहित करें।\r\n\r\nएक बात और याद रखिए आपको चौबीस घण्टे लगातार सोचते ही नही रहना है। जब आप सोचना बंद कर देते हैं, तो आप में असीमित शक्ति और अनुकूलता की अनुभूति होती है। उस शक्ति स्रोत की चमक आपके अंदर ही है  आपके बाहर नहीं। यदि आप इसे बाहर खोजेंगे, तो आपकी तलाश व्यर्थ हो जाएगी। अपनी आँखें बंद कीजिए और स्वयं में अन्तःस्थ हो जाइए। अपने अंतर्निहित शक्ति के अपार स्रोत से स्वयं को दीप्यमान कीजिए।",
        "card_description": "यह कार्ड हमें याद दिलाता है कि हमारे अंदर शक्ति का विशाल स्रोत संग्रह किया गया है। हम जब कोई सृजनात्मक आयोजन करते हैं, तो उसी विशाल स्त्रोत से हम अपना तादात्म्य स्थापित कर लेते हैं। जब भी हम कोई गतिविधि प्रारम्भ करते हैं, तो उसी स्रोत को हम अपनी सृजनात्मकता में प्रवाहित कर लेते हैं। लेकिन यह तभी संभव है, ज हम बिल्कुल शांत और ध्यानस्थ होकर उस स्रोत के संसर्ग में आएं ! \r\n\r\nयह शक्ति - स्रोत हम सभी के अंदर है। यह शक्ति वैसी ही है, जैसे व्यक्तिगतरूप से सूर्य हमें प्रकाश और ऊर्जा देकर हमारा पोषण करता हो और हमारे जीवन को शक्ति का भण्डार बना देता हो ! एक विशुद्ध ऊर्जा स्रोत हमारे अंदर मौजूद है, जिसकी थपथपाहट हमें महसूस होती रहती है। उस शक्ति से हम कुछ भी प्राप्त कर सकते हैं। हम क्रियाशील रहें अथवा आराम की इच्छा रखते हों, वह शक्ति सदैव हमारा स्वागत करती है। आपको घेरे से बाहर निकलकर दो कदम आगे बढ़ने और कहीं भी ढूंढ़ने की आवश्यकता नहीं है।",
