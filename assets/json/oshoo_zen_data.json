A fool is one who continues to trust others despite being deceived at every step. You deceive him again and again, he will believe you every time. Ultimately you will call him 'fool'.\nHe is a fool because his trust in you is beyond limits even after you cheat him again and again. Remember one thing here that he is a fool only until he has some kind of knowledge. What the so-called intelligent and knowledgeable people cannot understand, the fool can understand; Because the cunningness and cleverness of intelligent people closes his mind. A fool's faith and trust have reached such a level that you might betray him, but his trust in you will not waver even a bit.\nYou too become a fool according to your understanding of 'Tao' and 'Zen', but be careful not to build a wall of knowledge around yourself. After that, whatever experience you have, let it happen and then leave it there. Feel yourself healthy and fresh. Similarly, forget the sad incidents of your past that have happened continuously and try to live in the present. Make every day of your life feel new and happy; In the same way as a newborn baby would feel.\nGod says, 'Welcome into the Kingdom of God those who are like little children; Not little children!' Little children cannot enter there. They still have to pass through the worldly path; They have to taste worldly poison, which they will mistake for 'nectar'! After that they will start on the path of making themselves pure and pure. That experience will be enough for him. Therefore, only people 'not little children', 'like little children' are eligible to realize God; That is - those people, who have child-like innocence, like a fool!\nRemember one thing \u2013 having a child-like mentality or a fool-like innocence is not easy and not easy either! It will be very difficult for you to do this in the beginning, but it is not impossible, the world will take advantage of you by considering you a fool. He will serve his selfish interest by using you as a medium, but you should be rest assured. Let them do that. How poor and helpless such people are! Even if you have been cheated in the past; Even if they have been robbed again and again; Yet you allow it to happen; No response. No one can take away what is truly yours. No one can steal what is truly yours.",

If anything remains with her, it is only her innocence, purity and faith, symbolized by the white rose in her hand. As a sample, the colors of 'Terot' are visible in the form of four elements on his 'waistcoat'. This indicates that he is completely 'peaceful' surrounded by the coordinated unity of all four elements. At this time his power of intuition is at its peak. At this moment, it seems as if the power of the entire universe has entered inside that fool! He is so full of self-confidence that he is ready to take a leap into some unknown place.\r\nThe card indicates that if you consistently trust the power of your intuition, you will never make a wrong decision. It is possible that your actions may seem foolish to others; It is also possible that you too think the same way. But this can happen only when you analyze it with a rational mind. For the fool the place of 'zero' is a calculation without any number, where his faith and his innocence are his guide, and not his past experience and disbelief!",

No one will be able to complete it without you.\r\nThe entire existence is full of joy and happiness. You need to open the windows of your mind!

The concept that nature is far away from us or that we are separate from nature is a product of our mind.\r\nYou are standing at that point in time; Where you have to realize whether you are ready to accept that extraordinary gift; What makes you feel at home in that place?

If you understand this generally, then there is nothing else left for you to do, whatever you are doing is done through the truth. You are walking, that is the truth. When you sleep, truth rests; Whatever you speak speaks the truth. You are silent, that truth is silent. You feel silence and peace, that is the feeling of truth.\r\nThe moment you feel silent peace, that is the truth. That is silence! Silent peace means there is no sound inside you! Absence of all types of sounds, all types of sounds originate from the brain. In this void, your conscience inspires you in a certain direction. This guidance is not given through words or anyone's voice. This signal is wordless, completely silent; Otherwise it would have been absolutely impossible to find out the truth about what is the inner voice? Hence it is clear that no sound comes out in words from within.\r\nIn fact, when all kinds of sounds in the conscience become almost dead or complete silence prevails, in that situation your conscience becomes so capable that it can take your hand and go wherever it wants. The experience of silent silence of the conscience can be called a type of general 'meditation' or yoga method. By this simple method, gradually everything gets organized for you. Later you do not need any other technology. All your confusions end.\r\nWhen you get used to this type of method and feel complete inner well-being, you leave the 'meditation' method; And stop using medicines. You reach a state where you can live life as truth. You do not need any kind of memory system for life. Truth originates from the conscience; Whereas reaction is the product of the brain. When your life becomes the truth of the conscience, you will experience divine joy, fullness and freedom from your entire life. Life will become a musical prayer.

That crystal automatically expresses its purity and innocence, which goes beyond the prescribed limits and is received from the soul and God. The inner voice may also be playful or cheerful; Because sometimes it dives into the depth of emotions and sometimes it breaks all the barriers and goes further to the sky. This process is linked to the ordered world; In the picture, the crescent-shaped crown and the earth are represented by green leaves.\r\nSuch times often come in our lives; When we get attracted towards different types of sounds.

That is a special state, where you have inner presence. In other words, that is your internal approach, how you see things! Not every person can be a painter and there is no need for it. If everyone became a painter, this beautiful world would become very ugly; Where it becomes difficult for us to live. Similarly, not everyone can be a dancer \u2013 there is no need; But every person can be an initiator.\r\nCreation can be done only by being in tune with the sound of existence. The moment you are creating something, whether it is a poem, a song, a music, a dance or whatever, you are included in existence; In other words at that time you become a part of existence. You cannot remain separated from the existence of this living universe for long. In fact, you disappear from existence in those moments and existence starts creating through you.\r\nWhatever you do, if you do it cheerfully, if you do it lovingly; If what you are creating is not economic; So that will be called your creation or that is your creativity. If the creativity sprouting in your heart wants to develop. So that is spirituality, it is called divine. The more creative you become, the more divine you become.\r\nIt is said in all the religions of the world that the creator of this universe is God. I don't know whether God is the creator or not, but I definitely know that the more creative you become, the more divine you will become. When your creativity reaches its peak, when your entire life becomes creative, then your life becomes divine.

The revolutionary does not repeat the past in the present. He wants to bring something new into the world. Those people, who have hidden from the world and society, are called escapists or cowards. They have actually turned away from their responsibilities towards the country and society. But they do not understand that the moment they run away from their responsibilities, their freedom also disappears. These are the complexities of life, and this is the complexity of life that freedom and responsibilities both remain together or go away together.\r\nThose people who are self-conscious, no power can subjugate them; No one can enslave them. Those who have attained enlightenment are the biggest strangers in this world. Looking at them it doesn't seem like they can be associated with anyone. No institution, no society, no nation can imprison them, they cannot be kept within their limits; Because they are revolutionaries; Want to do something new for the society and nation - moving away from dilapidated traditions!",

Not because he is a traitor or a revolutionary, not because he is fighting against anyone or anything. In fact, because he has discovered his true nature and has determined to live accordingly. Garuda is the symbol of his enthusiasm, the messenger between earth and sky. The revolutionary challenges us to become as enthusiastic as him and fulfill the responsibility of living for the truth.\r\nThe revolutionary person, by becoming powerful, challenges us to assume and fulfill all the responsibilities. Along with that it challenges us to live the truth. A self-conscious person cannot be made a slave. Every talented person who has learned something finds it a little difficult to accept it.

The word that can come close to it in the English language is - nothingness, but the word is not as beautiful and capable of expressing feelings as 'nothingness!'\r\nThe goal of 'meditation' is to create emptiness within you. But this 'emptiness' has nothing to do with negative thoughts; There is abundance in this emptiness and such abundance is exciting. There is so much excitement in this abundance that it starts overflowing; It starts spilling out. Buddha described such a state of emptiness as an overflowing flow of kindness and compassion.\r\nTherefore, we should create such 'void' within ourselves; Because such emptiness does not mean 'nothing!' It causes excitement in abundance.\r\nSuch a void which is absolutely empty, empty \u2013 it creates invisible fear in man. If the void created within you is empty, it is negative; So that is like death for you. Such emptiness creates darkness within you. Where there is no happiness, no joy! In such emptiness there is neither song, nor music, nor dance, nor any heartbeat. What it means to say is that your life is completely like hell. Then why do you suffer hell-like tortures in such a state of emptiness?",

In such a situation nothing can be grasped; There is no path or direction in any direction. There is not even a hint of one's choice and the possibilities of achieving it. This was exactly the situation after the creation of the universe; From which there was immense potential to emerge and come into existence.\r\nAll you have to do is feel comfortable in this state of emptiness. Similarly, emptiness - in a state of absolutely silent peace, like between two words or between inhaling and exhaling the breath! In this situation, accumulate every free moment in which something new is going to arise.\r\nRemember here that 'emptiness' does not mean that there is nothing. The general meaning of emptiness is that it is complete. Here 'thing' means object. Every object has a definite shape. Therefore, the meaning of nothingness is no-thingness never means emptiness.\r\nEmptiness can have a definite meaning that there is something, rather than nothing at all. When the size of an object is fixed then that object becomes limited in its size. It cannot be called unlimited. Once we accept something or find its alternative, there too a definite shape of it emerges in the brain. All this is achieved after reaching the depth of meditation. This is the reality of human life.\r\nThoughts emerge in a state of emptiness. They have a fixed shape and then as soon as the thought changes, that shape disappears again. It cannot be hidden anywhere. Watch it take shape and even watch it disappear. Therefore, here zero cannot be used to mean 'nothing'.\r\nThus meditation is the medium to enter emptiness.",

The pure and highest level of love is 'compassion'. Hence 'sex' is below love and compassion is above love. The state between these two (sex and compassion) is love. Very few people know what love really is? In the eyes of others, love is madness. This is the viewpoint of people who don't even know what love is! Ninety-nine out of a hundred people, unfortunately, think that sex is love, but it is not so. Sexual pleasure is full of animality. Although love may develop from it, it is not love.\r\nSexual pleasure can be transformed into love; But for that you have to be alert and alert; One has to become meditative by immersing himself in deep meditation. When your intensity becomes pure and sacred, you will feel that it transforms into love, compassion. To achieve physical pleasure, love based on physical beauty is momentary and brute, not permanent. Sex is like a seed; In which the flower in the growing plant is like love. Love-compassion is the fragrance spread by a flower!\r\nWhile explaining compassion, Buddha has said that the combination of love and meditation is compassion. When your love does not desire anything from anyone; When your love is no longer just a need or selfishness; When your love is meant to be shared with others; When your love is not a beggar, but a king, an emperor; When your love does not ask for anything in return; Instead of this, you should be ready to give everything only to others, you are getting happiness by sharing your inner happiness with others, at that time you should include 'Meditation' in your love, then you will feel that the divine essence comes out of it. The fragrance spreads. That is compassion, a wonderful thing compassion!\r\nThe fragrance of love spreads in the form of compassion; But intimacy is necessary in such love. Intimacy exists only where there is closeness. Where there is close and intimate attachment, we allow others to look into our inner self, so that they can try to understand us by going into the depths of our heart. In the modern era intimacy is gradually disappearing; The reason for this is that there is nothing in a person's heart which he can share with others. There is no love in such a heart, there is disorder and ego. Love is the only goal of life's journey. Once your goals are clear, your inner prosperity will begin to develop. All the wounds of the heart will blossom into lotuses. This is the secret of love and this is the magic of love. Love is the most powerful chemical in the world.

The reason for this is that under the burden of our circumstances and expectations, our racial waves of sexual attraction remain suppressed. Love which is based on caste or sexual attraction never ends. This is the biggest problem of such love. If we accept this reality, we can truly enjoy sexual love; That's why! And when he is not there, say goodbye with gratitude.\r\nWhen we become accustomed and mature to this process, we can begin to experience such love. Love that exists outside of sexual attraction; A love that is full of self-respect for each other in the entire universe. Gradually we begin to understand that our partner often acts like a mirror, revealing a deep reflection of our inner feelings. There are no expectations or selfishness in this kind of love, there are no requirements, such love is completely free.

And - that seed is dead; Which has no contact with the earth; No contact with sky, air, sun, moon, stars etc. Till now this seed has not set any goal of establishing communication with existence. He is completely alone, closed on all sides, surrounded by a strong wall; As if he was lying in a grave of his own making!\r\nBut the seed tries; He sets his goal; It throws off the strong cover wrapped around itself and mobility arises in it. A struggle soon begins. The struggle of the seed begins with many complexities, adverse conditions and many obstacles. Like a seed, human life is full of struggles. The struggle of the seed lying in the deep darkness of the soil for its existence is a mirror of human life. Both require indomitable courage to survive.\r\nThere was no danger to the seeds. If he wanted, he had the ability to remain safe for centuries. But the germination of seeds was surrounded by many dangers. Still, that sprout starts moving towards something invisible unknowingly. Towards the sun, the source of light, but he doesn't know where he wants to go? And why? Yet his dream inspires him and the seed springs into action.\r\nLike seeds, human life also has characteristics. Don't remain a mere seed and remain in a dark tunnel separated from existence! Gather courage and abandon your ego; your safety\r\nDare to remove the armor; Abandon all comforts; Offer yourself to face external attacks and the arrival of terrible sorrows. But don't remain just a tree. A tree which cannot provide shade; Could not give the fragrance of flowers; Couldn't give the sweetness of fruits! A tree that does not bear flowers looks so poor! A tree without flowers is completely poor and empty. A tree devoid of flowers loses all that is necessary for survival. She has no beauty; Because beauty arises from love. The tree expresses its love only through flowers. Till now he has taken a lot from the sun, moon, stars, earth etc.; Now the time has come for him to give to this world and keep giving!",

In the background of the beauty of this flower, blooming with the touch of the golden rays of the sun, lies the story of a unique struggle from seed to becoming a flower. The indomitable courage of the seed till it becomes a beautiful flower is an inspiring force to awaken the identity of mankind and protect its existence. The process of germination of a seed lying in the dark inside the soil, breaking through impenetrable rocks and stones, coming out into the light of day and mingling with existence, is the result of extraordinary courage; It is a symbol of the small seed's huge heart and its greatness. A flower guides us through its intense passion for life, giving us the courage to come out of the darkness of despair and inaction and into the light.\r\nThere is no other way before us except to fight or face the challenges of life; Or there is no point in running away, hiding or denying those challenges. If that seed, with indomitable courage and struggling with adverse circumstances, can flourish on the earth, then Why not us? Therefore, gather courage and face all the challenges like a flower and fill the world with your fragrance and beauty.",

Love, prayer, birth, death, aesthetics, moments of blessedness etc. happen when you are alone; But who wants to be alone? Nobody wants to be alone. The biggest fear in this world is 'loneliness'. People can endure thousands of hardships; But cannot bear loneliness.\r\nWhen you are alone, you keep thinking about others. Loneliness is a negative state. In such a situation, different types of thoughts keep arising in your mind. In such a situation, such thoughts arise in your mind that at this moment, it would have been better if you had a friend, your wife, your loved one, your mother or your husband. But nothing like that.\r\nLoneliness is felt only when your\r\nindirect presence of no one\r\nWould have happened. But when you become part of a crowd, when you become part of devotees in a temple, church and mosque, you do not feel lonely. At that time you feel at ease.\r\nThe experience of loneliness in this world is truly a great miracle. This means that at that time you are not affiliated with any temple, mosque, church or any institution. Try to understand this situation. You are born alone and die alone. Both these moments are the greatest moments of life. Life begins and ends with loneliness.\r\nThere is a lot of difference between loneliness and isolation. Loneliness reveals the absence of others and solitude reveals one's own presence \u2013 loneliness is extremely positive. In loneliness you feel so complete within yourself that you can fill the entire universe with your presence, where no one else is needed.",

Don't fall; In this way, we enjoy truth by remaining steadfast in our approach. If you are also facing this type of situation, then now is the time, become awake and determine your new attitude towards your 'loneliness'.

Life keeps chasing death and death keeps chasing life. The changing cycle of time! Happiness is followed by sorrow and sorrow is followed by happiness; Love is always followed by hate and hate is always followed by love. Success is followed by failure and failure is followed by success. Lord Buddha has called the continuous flow of life and death as 'the cycle of life and death'.\r\nAny newness does not arise from within you, it always comes from outside. You have already established a pattern for living your life. You are hesitant in bringing any change or there is an invisible fear. While adopting any new thing, you do not want to forget your previous life. You want to live your life on one path; Because you believe in him. But when something new knocks at your door, your previous way of life starts to fall into disarray. If you accept any new idea or any new system in your life, then that newness transforms you and you experience change in yourself.\r\nOne thing is worth noting here. By accepting any newness in life, you will feel confused in yourself; Because you don't know where and how the new path will end. The previous part of your life is familiar; You have been colored in the same color for a long time. The new is completely unknown to you. The new can be your friend as well as your enemy. Only by accepting newness can you get the opportunity to recognize and assimilate it. You can't ignore this new path too much; Because your old way of living your previous life could not give you what you are looking for! Your previous way of life is not unknown to you, but it is certainly miserable.\r\nNow the question arises that how can our new transformation take place? Generally everyone wants to become new. This requires courage. Courage is also not ordinary; Requires extraordinary courage. There is no newness within us which we can present outside and experience newness in ourselves. Newness comes from outside only. Any newness enters from existence. The human brain always remains old. The brain is never new. Newness is a wonderful gift of existence that comes from outside.\r\nThe moment you accept the newness deep within your soul, a complete transformation can take place in you, which can also be called a complete transformation. You cannot bring change in your life yourself, you cannot bring any newness from within yourself. Newness in you always comes from outside. You can either accept that newness or reject it. If you reject Him, you will remain no more than a stone statue, completely abstract or dead. If you accept the new, it can make you as soft and fragrant as a flower, a new door can open in your life, where joy will be the only experience.",

In the inner part of the circle there are eight figures of 'I Ching' and below them, four powers in the four directions are shown in the form of light in the central part within a triangle. The rotating triangle is indicating upward divinity. In the central place of the triangle is the symbol of man and woman, which is shown in the form of creation and acceptance.\r\nIt is often said that if there is one thing in the world that never changes, it is the change in oneself. Change in life is continuous. The cycle of human birth, development, death and rebirth is always in motion. Overall adverse circumstances in man's life continue to play their role in his lifestyle. If you look at the outer edge of the circle, you will feel dizzy. If you turn towards the center within the circle, there is stability, peace in the center of the storm revolving around you and you will understand so much that you can come out of it.\r\nIf you want to bring change in your life, you will have to adopt something new. That too not in a fragmentary form, it has to be adopted deeply and completely. By doing this you can be transformed. You cannot bring anything new into your life, the new enters automatically. All you can do is either accept it or reject it. If you reject it, then understand that you have become just a stone block or have become completely closed or dead. If you accept or accept it, then you have become a flower whose buds are about to open.\r\nThus, when we accept something new in life, life begins from there. That newness is a messenger for you and the life after that is a message. Transformation in life can be achieved only when we hear the new, see the new and know the new. Although to achieve something new in the path of life, a kind of fear of the unknown is felt before accepting it. Instead of being afraid, you should embrace the newness. to do this\r\nWith this, your life will gradually move towards prosperity and one day you will feel yourself transformed.",

The second word is Break Through, that is, to develop from the state of break down and move towards progress, that is, to enter the new world; Where you get a new perspective, new dream and new perspective.\r\nSuch a situation is a state of delirium in our life. At that time we are not aware of any meditation; At that time all our arguments become irrelevant. After this, the process of break through i.e. development begins. In that situation you enter a new world with a new outlook, new dreams and new perspective.\r\nWhen you ever get into this type of 'nervous breakdown' or delirium, don't panic; Don't worry. Face the challenge posed by such a devastating situation. In that case, do not be afraid that you are becoming a victim of madness! This is not right. In that situation you become heart oriented; Become self-centered, so that you can find a new path of progress to face the present challenge. In case of brain break down, gradually turn towards the conscience, from where the door to a new opportunity will open for you. In such a situation, the breakdown may turn into a breakthrough.\r\nBy the time you reach a state of breakdown, the structure of thoughts inside your brain has been shattered. You lose control over it. At such a moment that level of the brain becomes completely independent. Modern psychology indicates several disciplines in this subject; With the help of which you can come back to normal condition. In case of a breakdown your previous brain (previous collection of thoughts) has disappeared. In such a situation, a state of emptiness is created in your mind between the previous and next thoughts. From here the person is oriented towards the heart.\r\nThere are two levels of energy within us. The first level is very light or thin. In this first layer of energy we perform routine day-to-day tasks. Such as getting up from bed in the morning, taking breakfast after bathing, going to office or job, earning money and coming back home etc. are different types of tasks.\r\nWhen we are in a state of meditation, we get strength from the energy of the first layer within us. This is a new type of work; Because at that time the brain continues to work on its old pattern; New energy is not available. In such a situation, if you want to do anything at that moment, you will feel frustrated and tired. From there the breakthrough (development) starts within you. This is the second layer of energy in the brain, in which the energy is so sufficient that you will never feel tired.\r\nThe brain is a storehouse of contradictory thoughts. Different types of thoughts; Thinking, the complexities of thousands of thoughts keep fighting with each other; keeps making noise; And - they collide with each other and keep distracting you; Dispels your drowsiness. Thousands of thoughts keep dragging you towards themselves in a single moment. Even in such a situation, taking them all along is a miracle! Every thought in your mind wants to fight with you and pull you towards itself. In such a situation you fall into terrible confusion; This has been called the brain or mind. Where the functioning of the brain gets blocked and becomes in a state of breakdown. That is, it almost becomes dead.\r\nOne thing is worth noting here. There is no guarantee that every 'breakdown' will turn into a 'breakthrough'. Yes, it is certainly important that 'breakdown' can be 'breakthrough'; If that moment is used properly, then...!",

At that moment it seems to us that we should do something, anything\u2026' whereas it is a different matter if that thought of ours later reaches such a level that there may be some mistake in doing so; There may be a mistake; In such a situation, throw away whatever burden, obstacles and hindrances there are on the mind. These forces keep you confined within a circle. If you do not do this, your life will be filled with unrest, failure and complex problems.\r\nYou should abandon the ancient way of life and old beliefs and move forward on the new path of life with new zeal and enthusiasm. Fill your new life with happiness through this breakthrough.\r\nWhenever you drive a car, you have to change its gear. When you change gears, there comes a moment when that gear becomes neutral for some time. Now he has to roam around in the same situation. Neutral gear means no gear.

There are three important steps to transformation: (1) Do not resist evil. (2) Know that your opponents are not actually opponents, but are worthy of your complement or compliment; They are indispensable for you. Therefore they are without options. (3) You become your own witness. Because if you become a witness to the sufferings and disasters you have experienced, you will be able to relate to them.\r\nWhen you become a witness to your own struggles, sufferings and failures, you will see a huge difference.

Only those who have the courage to enter into a limitless existence by breaking the inconsistencies, disparities, reasons, apprehensions and all the bonds of the mind of life, are successful in transformation.\r\nMost of the people think that the path on which they are living their life is bright and joyful. If their answer is 'no', then they will definitely have to take the risk of rethinking their way of life and transforming the old path. For that, a new path, new lifestyle and new research will have to be adopted. Remember one thing here that you have nothing to lose in such a change. Till now you have not achieved any success, happiness or inner peace from your old lifestyle. The old way of life has become meaningless for you. A new path, new lifestyle, and new efforts can be meaningful in your life. For this you will have to have extraordinary courage and indomitable willpower. People who are infatuated with the old and are leading heavy lives, take the help of 'Philosophy' to make their meaningless things meaningful. They do not have the courage to break the old dilapidated system and come out.

By accepting the problems like sorrow, grief and obstacles etc. that come in your life, understand their reality. Make a new version of them.\r\nThe process of transformation is also like death. The time of transformation, like death, has its own time; Because it takes you from one dimension to another. This form of yours is external. Therefore, the process of transformation starts from the external form.

Unless you shed the cloak of your personality; Till then you cannot recognize your true nature; Can't feel my self-respect. Self-respect is a guarantee of existence; Whereas personality is the gift of society; It is a facility provided by the society. The identity of your personality given by society is masking your real identity. See an example of a beautiful moral story in this regard.\r\nA pregnant lioness was crossing the road by jumping on high mountain ridges when during that time she gave birth to a child. The child fell into the herd of sheep grazing below. The sheep took care of the lioness's cub and raised it, but they did not know that it was the cub of a lion, the enemy of the sheep. Even the lion did not know that he was a lion's child; Because there was a herd of sheep all around him. Therefore, that lion also lives in the company of sheep and walks, eats, drinks, runs and speaks in the same way like a sheep. The lion cub never knew he was a lion! The reason for this was that from birth till he grew up, he lived in a herd of sheep. That is why his eating, drinking, walking, running, speaking etc. everything was like that of a sheep.\r\nThe lion, the king of the jungle, always roams alone. Lions never live in packs. With one of his roars, the entire surrounding area, animals and creatures etc. tremble. But in that lion living with the sheep, everything except the physical structure was similar to that of the sheep. Gradually he had grown up, but he did not know that he was a lion.\r\nOne day when an old lion saw that scene, he could not believe his eyes! Till now in his life, he had never seen a lion roaming around like a sheep in a herd of sheep. There was no possibility of friendship between the two. The old lion could not believe his eyes at all. He suddenly ran towards the sheep and all the sheep started running away screaming. The young lion also screamed in the same manner and started running away in fear. With great difficulty the old lion managed to catch the young lion; But the young lion kept crying, screaming and trembling like a sheep.\r\nThe old lion dragged the young lion to a pond. The young lion was so powerful that if he had known that he was a lion, the old lion would not have been able to even touch him! But he had become a sheep. That's why he was scared, he was trembling.\r\nA miracle happened on the pond. The old lion encouraged the young lion to look inside the well. While peeping into the pond, their images were visible in the water. As soon as he saw his own reflection he transformed into a young lion; Because in reality it was not a sheep! His personality was like that of a sheep, because his external personality was formed in the society of sheep. When the young lion saw his form for the first time, a roar came from within him, which echoed to the surrounding hills. The lion found his true identity, who he really is?\r\nExternal factors play important roles in the structure of your personality. Society, civilization, education, etc. have a special role in building your personality. What this means is that your personality is given to you by others. Look at a four-five year old child; Whose personality has not yet developed. It will still take a long time. Therefore, at this time that four-five year old child is his own personality, that is his identity. He has not yet been influenced by external thoughts, to understand this you turn back to your past. Reach there, when you would have been a small child of about three-four years. At this time, try to feel like a three-four year old child, but you will not remember anything. From then till now a long gap of time has formed. You will not remember anything because you had no personality at that time. When you were born on this earth, you did not have any name. You received education, studied and attained a certain qualification. When you were born, you were neither an engineer, nor a doctor, nor a professor. All these abilities kept getting added to you. Your name, degree, your fame... etc. characteristics became associated with you and became the identity of your personality. In that personality you were buried under many layers. If your personality made up of external factors is taken out, you will be left like a zero blank slate. That is your real identity. Your real personality is what you feel is best. Quite apart from the external personality, you are not what you learned from others; That is your personality. You have to regain your disorder-free, innocent form. That is your real identity.",

As soon as the cub is born from the womb of a lioness, the cub falls down from the hills into the herd of sheep. After this, his overall upbringing, care, speaking, grazing etc. became like that of a sheep and the lion cub considered himself a sheep. After being caught by the old lion, the young lion came to know his true identity. The old lion caught him and took him to the bank of a pond and after seeing his reflection in the water of the pond, the young lion realized that he was not a sheep but a lion, the king of the jungle. There are many such people among us in the society; Like that young lion, people consider the cover of their external personality to be their real identity. By considering the personality imposed by outsiders as our real identity, we too live in a herd like sheep and consider ourselves sheep; Unable to move freely, completely unaware of their own identity. But, this is the time to know your own reality! To recognize your real face in the mirror of your conscience!",

It is generally seen that when we come out of deep sleep, we gradually come into a state of complete wakefulness. First of all we give up deep sleep; After this the dreams gradually disappear while floating; The existence of dreams lasts only for a brief moment. But on the contrary, sometimes it also happens that suddenly something happens that we come out of deep sleep like an arrow and come straight into the waking state. In that situation your eyes remain open and you keep wondering, 'Where am I?' 'Who am I?' Nothing becomes clear for a moment; You lose all your identity.

If a person goes into a forest; If you go to mountains and caves, you will definitely experience a kind of silence or peace; But this is actually a negative peace. One experiences peace there because there is no noise of the market; There is no traffic noise there. Not the roar of a flying airplane; There is no noise of barking dogs and crowd of humans. That's why there is silence; Because there is absence of noise; But that is not real peace; There is a negative silence.\r\nYou are nothing alone. The entire existence has complete dominance over you. The total force of existence has complete authority over you. In such a moment, when silence penetrates inside you, at that moment you understand its power. It happens suddenly. Gautam Buddha had a similar experience; Which he called 'zero'. In other words, such power or silence can be called 'silence'. Which is spread in the depth of your conscience. You can experience real peace or total silence only when you focus your attention deep within your inner self away from the explosive hustle and bustle of the external environment. Such peace and such silence is present within you.\r\nThere are very few people among us who really like peace or silence. Although many people say that they like to live in peace or silence. But when the moment comes to remain quiet or silent, they do not like to remain silent or quiet. They immediately turn towards some play or entertainment. Some activity or the other starts. They become frightened by the atmosphere of silence. The more silent you remain, the more invisible your existence becomes. As long as your mind is in control of you, you are the embodiment of noise. The center point of noise and commotion is your ego. In these moments of terrible noise and destruction, when your mind becomes invisible, when your mind becomes in a state of 'nothingness'; So instead of noise, a strange silence prevails. At that time both your mind and your ego disappear like steam.\r\nIf a person loves peace or silence, it is certain that he loves the entire existence.

What we call mind or brain is nothing but all those misconceptions which you have stored in your brain; It is piled up. These illusions are of different types, like illusion of memories, illusion of imagination, illusion of dreams, illusion of hopes and desires. At the root of all these misconceptions is a great illusion \u2013 the ego of \u2018I am\u2019. All kinds of misconceptions revolve around this. Between these two your reality gets destroyed.\r\nThe simple meaning of meditation is to come out of the confusing circle of dreams, aspirations, imaginations and past and future, which are wrapped around you like a blanket. At such a moment, completely coming out of these illusory factors and not having any thoughts in your mind at that time is your real identity; That is your reality. To come out of misconceptions, you should set immediate goals; Because we have been carrying these misconceptions in our lives for a long time. In other words, it has become your habit to live life under the influence of illusion or illusion. The hopes of your life are alive in those illusions. We are alive with the help of those hopes. To give up on them means to give up on the future; Abandon all hope! How can we carry our present without hope?\r\nLiving your present without any hope or expectation is an art, but remember one thing here that living a life without hope does not mean living a life with despair. The general meaning of a life without hope is - the present is so beautiful that who should worry about the future! Who can bear the imaginary burden of the future in the present? One is the person whose present is empty and full of despair; But there is one whose present is so beautiful and perfect that he has no space to think about the future.\r\nThe person who lives a life full of disappointments, his life remains empty. He doesn't know what the present is? The future of such a person becomes invisible. There are lakhs and crores of such people in the world, who get crushed between the stones of past and future and ultimately become the grip of death. Living a life without hope or expectations means living in the present. Always think that there is no tomorrow. Whatever we see, whatever appears before us, is the present. If you adopt such an approach in your life, then understand that a new life has been infused within you.\r\nOften we think only about the past and future, because our present remains completely empty. We don't know at all how to live those moments! The result is that, either we live the past in the present which no longer matters; The future has no meaning in the present. The moments between the two are everything in life.\r\nThe correct meaning of ILLUSION in the English language cannot be illusion or delusion. Where there is confusion, we mistakenly consider one thing to be another thing. Whereas it is not so here. In the darkness of the night, we jump on a piece of rope lying on the road, mistaking it for a snake, but immediately the illusion breaks and we come out of the illusion. But after slipping from our present, we keep running towards past and future under illusion, in which there is illusion of beautiful dream coming true and that is Maya! If you throw it away, your beautiful present will be visible in your vision and not the emptiness of past and future.",

When we look at our outer shell, often we too are not able to take the right decision amidst the confusion of true and false, good and bad, love-hate, hope-disappointment, etc. Therefore, if you look at all these misconceptions, when you return to the depths of your soul, you will clearly understand the difference between dreams and reality.\r\nGenerally people think mostly about the past and future. Whereas past and future do not exist. The result is that we destroy our present by thinking about the invisible consequences of the past and future. If we start living between past and future then life can be happy. There is often a fear of snakes after seeing a rope lying on the road in the dark of night. This is our illusion. When we realize the truth, our illusions are shattered. Living a life without hope or expectations means living in the present.\r\nWhatever we see, whatever is visible in front of us and whatever is present around us is our present. The past cannot be brought into the present; Whereas what is going to happen in the future is all invisible.

You do not have to listen to their principles, opinions, their arguments and their debates, you have to listen to their virtues like politeness, kindness, beauty, humility in the eyes etc. You have to listen to the glorious aura that surrounds them. Touches you like a cool breeze of early morning. Once you have found such a Guru (Master), understand that you have found the key to the power you seek.\r\nIt is not difficult to find such a Guru or such a Master; But the condition is that you should be available from within, not through words. Not just through words, because truth does not come out of words!\r\nThe place of truth lies in the empty space between words and sentences. If you are near such a Guru, you will experience a special power. It is not difficult to find such a Guru. If there is anything lacking, it is only in you.",
                "card_discription": "In Zen the guru cannot be anyone else's guru; Rather he is his own guru. His entire activities and each of his words reflect his high spiritual state and supreme happiness. He has no personal aspiration, desire or expectation, which is more suitable than his present level. His disciples and followers gather around him not just to follow him, but to soak in the divinity spreading in his presence and to be inspired by the examples of his life. His disciples see their truth floating in the eyes of that great guru. They easily feel themselves drowning in its peaceful silence.\r\nThe Guru not only welcomes his disciples to teach them lessons and guide them, but he also wants to share his experiences with the disciples. In this way He creates a field of power which illuminates the entire universe with His wonderful soul. If you have found such a Guru, then he is a wonderful blessing for you. If you are not looking for such a Guru, then learn enough from your teachers, imbibe those qualities and attain Guruship yourself.",

Poverty is man's creation; Man is created.\r\nThe meaning of life is abundance, richness, abundance in every possible measure. Take a look at existence. Do you think existence is poor? Look at millions of flowers, enjoy their fragrance. Look at the billions and billions of stars; Can you count them? You can see at most three thousand stars with your naked eyes, which is nothing in proportion to the number of stars. Those stars are spreading; Are expanding openly. Just as when a flower blooms, its petals spread open and move away from the centre. Similarly, this universe is constantly dynamic, changing, alive and developing, which is the factor of increase in its prosperity and abundance.\r\nMany people do not know what life is for? Because such people have not lived life yet! Yes, it is true that such people are definitely born in this universe, but mere birth is not enough to stay alive. Such humans will take birth on this earth and lead an inactive life and will think that they are alive. Similarly, living in inactivity, one day we will leave this world; Without living life and enjoying life, without knowing the real secrets of life, we will say goodbye to the world. This is not for any particular person, most of the people in the world are living a similar life. what is life ? What an irony it is that life ends without knowing this!\r\nSuch incidents keep happening every day. Many people, after reaching the last stage of life, have accepted this and said - 'What a strange experience! For the first time in my life, I have realized that I have wasted my entire life!' If you are alive, then for what? Living a half-hearted life is not the purpose of life. To live means to live with abundance. To live holistically. Living with prosperity and prosperity. Now the question arises, what is the meaning of a prosperous and fulfilling life? A fulfilling and prosperous life does not mean having piles of money and wealth.\r\nProsperous and holistic life means making life more and more pleasant, more comfortable and loving, making life more and more acceptable. You have to be perfect, that is, you have to become rich in body, rich in science, rich in meditation, complete consciousness. The man who is ignorant of the great world of music is extremely poor; He has lost the beautiful chapter of his life. How can a person who has not enjoyed Pt. Ravi Shankar's sitar, Shivkumar Sharma's santoor and Jagjit Singh's ghazals enjoy the sun rising in the morning? How can one experience the beauty of the moon surrounded by twinkling stars in the sky?

A rich person can become generous only when he has gained a deep understanding that wealth is useless! Rich people are meaningless to this society. When that person realizes that all the things that this world can give are meaningless; They are valueless, at that time the only thing left is generosity, which we should share.\r\nMan's greatest wealth is his generosity. This is a wealth which does not diminish when distributed. Generosity exists only where there is poverty. No poor man says that he is not generous and no rich man is generous to anyone spontaneously.

The person who keeps collecting things is called miser. Whatever we collect, we cannot take it with us from here. Therefore, it would be better if we do not be stingy in distributing whatever we have stored in our mind. This is generosity.\r\nIf you do not have such an attitude, then you will develop an attitude of acquiring more and more and accumulating more and more. There is no end to this longing. If you do not become alert, alert, then all the prosperity and splendor of this world will be reduced; Because the mind cannot bear the weight of what you have. The mind is never satisfied with material things. The only thing that bothers him is that he needs more. The meaning is that the mind is never satisfied!\r\nThe nature of the mind is that it wants more. The desires of a rich man are never satisfied by the wealth he has; He wants more.\r\nThe conclusion is that generosity is real wealth. The sign of generosity is to share whatever you have.

You can smile and both of you can exchange your feelings, and when you do that, you are generous. If someone is sad, can't you sing a song? You can be generous at that moment \u2013 your smile and song cost nothing!\r\nRegarding money, you too can become a very rich person; But in real sense you will remain poor; Because you would not like to share anything with anyone. Even your wife, children, relatives, friends etc. will become strangers to you. A miser or a greedy person keeps himself enclosed in a circle from all sides, with no door to meet him. The life of such an insignificant person is like that of a dead body lying in a grave. His inner consciousness is suppressed.\r\nThe question here is not that you should share something! Here the question is about general exchange, which is related to our inner consciousness. You have nothing; But you have a big heart.

Celebrate at your pure leisure; You will see; A sweet song will emerge from within you; That song will be a song of your awareness, your alertness.

You will no longer be an 'outsider'. The entire universe, the entire existence will be with you!",

At that time our situation becomes like that of a helpless child, we feel like this. There is nothing surprising in this. The roots of such emotions become strong within us since childhood; This is our problem. The reason for this is that these emotions are located so deeply that they start playing like a 'tape' at any time in our lives.

Just behind the idol of God, even the demon is hidden in an invisible form; Because without demons God does not exist!\r\nWhenever two things come before us as options and both are of almost equal quality, then it becomes difficult for us to choose one of them. There we try to compromise. Compromising is equivalent to denying the truth. When we do compromise, we get stuck in uncertain and wrong situations.\r\nIf we think seriously, we will realize that generally we keep trying to achieve something or the other. In an effort to achieve something, sometimes we differ on some issues. In such a situation we need the support of others. Where an alternative is sought after taking support, some compromise has to be made and the result obtained from the compromise is bitter.\r\nNo religion can accept you completely. Some things are ignored, some have to be fought for, some have to be destroyed. Is not completely accepted. Their reasoning for not accepting you completely is, 'We accept your love; Not your hatred! Throw out your hatred; Destroy it and that's a big problem; Because the moment you completely destroy hatred, love is also destroyed. Love and hate are not two, they are one. They say - 'We accept your silence, but not your anger'. Destroy your anger. Your vitality will automatically be destroyed. You will not be alive, you will be nothing more than a living corpse. Silence is not life, it is a kind of death!\r\nReligion divides you into two parts \u2013 divine or sacred, divine and demonic, sinful! If the evil or monstrosity within you is destroyed, then divinity will automatically be destroyed. They accept divinity or purity, but reject evil or demonicity. If a person follows them then he will realize that the moment a person destroys the demon within him, the god within him is automatically destroyed.\r\nNo one actually follows his teachings; Because their preaching is useless. Then what do people do there? The answer is clear \u2013 people cheat! This is how everyone is cheating you; Confusing! And all these religions have created a similar ostentation. If you accept that ostentation, then you have also become ostentation! Now you are following them, then understand that you are dead, only their pomp is alive in your body. If you don't listen to them, you feel an invisible, unknowing feeling of guilt.\r\nWhat will you do now? If you follow them, you will become dead even though you are alive. If you don't follow them, you will always suffer from guilt; What will you do in such a situation? In such a situation, cunning people will take advantage of it and force you to compromise.\r\nThis is ostentation. In the present era the whole world has become pompous; There is no honesty visible anywhere. Unless these disruptive religions and religions are eradicated, no person can be honest. All religions are preaching you about honesty, but they have become the foundation of every kind of dishonesty. They are teaching you dishonesty. They're teaching you that; Which you cannot do!\r\nAll religions and all sects are leading people towards the wrong path. They are turning humans into sheep and not humans. A true and authentic religion turns man into a 'lion' and the lion walks alone; Not in the crowd. That's why he doesn't have to compromise anywhere. Being in a crowd forces people to compromise.

Putting it in is another matter.\r\nIf we think about this matter deeply, we will generally find that our attitude is that we are always trying to achieve something; Be it power, or support from other people!

It is not limited by any distance or time.\r\nIf you are impatient, you lose your patience while waiting for some achievement, then understand that this event will never happen in your life. Because being too impatient, losing patience can cause you to lose a lot rather than gaining something.

Faith and trust will emerge in your life only when you keep your mind and brain aside! And then ?\r\nThen your life will overflow with infinite power. Then your life ceases to be ordinary, it becomes completely divine.\r\nFaith is everything in life. Knowing that existence is our mother; Nature is the source of our life; And that existence and nature cannot be against us; cannot be harmful to us; Seeing and understanding them, faith and trust arise within us. At that time, negative forces like fear, doubt, and uncertainty etc. go away.\r\nSuppose a person has to jump; But before jumping the person has a doubt in his mind! If he thinks that the doubt should go away before he jumps, remember - that time will never come, because doubt is a self-generated process of the individual. Once a doubt arises, a second, third, fourth, etc. is created from it. Exactly the same is the process of developing faith. Once faith is created, the second... third... fourth... etc. is created from it.\r\nWhenever you start something new, a kind of uncertainty surrounds you. No one can start with a whole heart. At that time there is always doubt somewhere; But don't pay that much attention to doubt; Instead, strengthen your faith and belief. Gradually the doubts will reduce and faith will become stronger.\r\nSo keep in mind \u2013 if you think that when the doubts are removed, then you will start; So it is definitely impossible for this to happen. That time will never come. You should have faith even when there is doubt. Only then can you be successful.",
                "card_discription": "This is the moment to have the courage to jump into the sky without any rope; But this courage cannot come without faith or belief. Only he gets the courage to jump into the infinite, in whom there is no room for doubt. Only that person has the courage and passion to jump into the unknown, who is not afraid of death despite knowing that there is no means of safety. Don't be afraid of defeat! We are ready to jump into the unknown only when we do not have even the slightest doubt. What will happen next? Without worrying about it, without worrying about the consequences.\r\nWhile starting any initiative or any campaign, if you think about prior planning, preparations, favorable time etc., then remember, that time never comes. The obstacles of victory-defeat, success-failure etc. arise only when you do not have strong faith or belief. In the card we get a hint that there is someone waiting for us at the other end. That wait could be to welcome soft flower petals or for a bright future.",

All the stars, planets, constellations, sun and moon of space are related to you and are in contact with you. You can disappear anywhere in the blue of the sky. Well, all you have to do is break the cage and get out of it. Then the whole sky is yours. Spread your wings and fly beyond the sun like the eagle.\r\nIt is often seen that the more information our brain receives, the more we experience it. All this information helps in increasing our understanding. The more you try to understand, the richer your store of knowledge and your store of information will be. If you want, you can become a scholar on that basis.\r\nFreedom is very important in a person's life. As long as you remain trapped in various bondages, you cannot attain real understanding or knowledge. Till then you cannot realize liberation. You can gain knowledge or wisdom only when you have gained enough experience. Wisdom does not come from outside your experience. If you want, you can pile up words, you can become a scholar. But then you will be caught in a new kind of illusion. Such an illusion... such an illusion, which will create information. The more information your brain receives, the more you will begin to feel.\r\nIn a way, 'information' may be synonymous with 'knowing', but it is not! To know is a different process altogether; to know is to experience; While the information gets piled up for our memory system. Unless you come out of it, you will not be able to experience freedom within.\r\nIn your inner sky, in your inner world, liberation or freedom is the most important quality.",

The shape of a small bird is visible in the picture; It seems that he is calling other birds with his divinity, encouragement and charm! The bird seen in the cage is slowly spreading its wings. He is ready to take his first flight.\r\nThat bird has gained new understanding and new information that the cage always remained open. The sky was already there to fly; But till now he was not aware of the sky and unlimited energy within him. Till now he continued wandering in self-generated illusions. This is such a wonderful opportunity in the life of that bird that it can jump into the infinite and experience the joy of being free. All his illusions have been shattered.",

In love, some feeling of gluttony remains, but in friendship every kind of greediness disappears. There is no question of using anything else here; The question here is not that someone else's support is needed! You have a lot, and you love to share it. Whoever will share in your happiness by participating with you in your songs, dance, music etc.; You will be filled with gratitude towards him. You will express your gratitude towards him. It is not that others have thanked you or done you any favor.\r\nGreed or greed, in some form or the other, remains hidden somewhere in love. You will be surprised to know that the word LOVE in English is taken from Sanskrit \u0932\u094b\u092d (LOBH). Lobha means greed, with time the same word gradually became LOVE. 'Love' means a kind of greed is hidden in the background of love; Whereas in true friendship there is a feeling of sacrifice or giving something for each other.\r\nIn friendship, there is a feeling of friendship in true sense i.e. giving everything to the other (friend) without any expectation. Being ready to give your every happiness, every sorrow and every comfort and the one who accepts it gratefully without any expectation, that is friend, friendship and amity! There is no question of needing each other here. There is no question here that when you fall into any danger, your friends rush to save you! This is completely inconsistent - he may also come; Can't even come! But remember - if he does not come, you should not complain about him. If he comes, you are grateful, if he doesn't come, you are grateful too!\r\n\ufeffFriendship is a great art; There is 'art', in friendship there is no specific person, whom we can especially call our friend. In friendship it does not happen that you maintain friendship only with some special or certain people. If your thought is like this, then understand that it is your rotten and corrupt thought. Instead of establishing friendship, it is better to be friendly to everyone. The feeling of friendship should become a special quality of yours or an identity of your personality.\r\nThe mutual relationship of the entire existence should be friendly. If you have a sense of friendship with existence; Then existence will shower upon you a thousandfold feeling of friendship. If you throw flowers towards existence, existence will cover you with countless flowers in return. Friendship is the mirror of life. Your face is reflected in the mirror. Have a sense of friendship. Your entire life will be filled with the feeling of friendship!",

Then see how much spirituality flows within you! There will be no visible distance between life and temple. Look inside your life! There will be no sadness anywhere. Have you ever seen a tree sad and worried? Have you seen any bird worried and distressed? Have you ever seen any animal vigorous? No; Life is not like that. Nature has its own order; There is specificity. Man can make mistakes, but not nature!\r\nEvery moment of life is meant to be celebrated. Every moment of life is full of joy. You just have to find the source of that happiness. Make life itself a celebration, when you enter the temple, there should be a feeling of joy and happiness on your face. The temple is not for serious people. You look back at your life. Do you see sadness anywhere? No.\r\nMay you always remain normal. Don't try to be clever and very intelligent. Have you seen any creature going mad? Madness is a delusion of yours. Life is not like this. There is some intelligence in our life and there is also some foolishness. Try not to be wiser and more foolish. Life is a tree, try to understand it.\r\nBut, remember one thing here, animals can only play; While man enjoys it; Celebrates the festival. Enjoying, celebrating, celebrating festivals is the exclusive right of only human beings. Animals cannot do this. They cannot rejoice and be happy. Animals can only play. There is a feeling of gratitude and blessedness hidden in joy and celebration. This is a gift given only to man, but it is something to be understood and felt. Existence has poured out its ocean of immense love for us to maintain an atmosphere of joy and celebration. There is a need to squeeze joy from those sources!\r\nTransforming every moment in the flow of life into joy and celebration is a great art of living. Don't stop the feelings of joy rising within you; Don't wait for another moment; You can turn any moment into joy and celebration. You don't need to search for anything. Life needs joy and celebration, and you have it. Life is necessary to celebrate and enjoy. For joy and celebration, trees, birds, moon and stars are needed and they are all available to you.\r\nIf you are a king, you have a golden crown on your head, then you are in a special bond. You cannot celebrate and celebrate your heart; Because till date no one has seen any emperor or king dancing, jumping and enjoying in any street. Because a king or emperor remains imprisoned under certain special formalities.\r\nWhy don't you rejoice? The reason is - something has disappointed you greatly; Because of which you can neither sing nor dance; Nor can we rejoice. Your life has become the life of a handicapped and lame person. You consider yourself very ordinary; In another sense, you are a victim of inferiority complex and frustration. You don't have anything special, because of which your joy and celebration is dead; But who told you that joy and celebration require a special achievement?\r\nYou can enjoy and be happy even by living a normal life. Even your ordinary life will be considered extraordinary compared to others. There is no need for any special occasion or any prior preparation to celebrate. If you keep thinking like this, you will never be able to enjoy. Similarly, life will end while living the life of a beggar.\r\nWhatever path you find to live life, adopt it; Find joy in it and forget all the negative things and have a positive attitude. Dancing, jumping and singing songs are not a part of life. You have many ways to express your inner happiness. Embrace life within yourself. Adopt maximum openness, have maximum sensory access; All those things are scattered around you, which can make your life joyful and festive. You need to change your thinking; To look at life from a positive perspective!",

When the same joy crosses the limits, it is expressed in song, dance or laughter, at that time tears of gratitude well up in the eyes.\r\nWhen you select this card, it indicates to you that there are many small and big opportunities in your life, which you can express in joy and celebration.

                "card_english_content": "Turning inward does not mean turning completely. Going inward does not mean going inside. The general meaning of turning inward is that you are constantly running through life to satisfy desires here and there, but again and again you fall into the pit of disappointment and frustration. If your every wish is not satisfied, it makes you sad and frustrated. Desires are not satisfied merely by wishing or desiring; You may never reach your goal. In such a situation, inner peace is impossible.\r\nWhen you will understand the truth that running after desires makes you useless, then you will stop running after them. You won't need to make any effort to stop. It automatically gets postponed. Even if you make any effort, your running will start again.\r\nIn the same way, if you make any effort to go into your inner self, then you should understand that you are still running in the outside world. The more you try to turn within, the more you will go outside. All the journeys undertaken are related to the outside, not the inside.\r\nThen how can you go into the inner self? The simple answer is that you are always present within yourself. There is no aim to go up from there. The moment you stop chasing desires, your entire journey also gets postponed. The moment your mind becomes free from the fog of desires, you become stable within yourself. This is called turning inwards.\r\nOnce you are centered within yourself, all your energy cannot move anywhere else. One thing to keep in mind here is that turning inward does not mean that you move inward. When all your energy is concentrated and stable in one place, when there is no activity of any kind, when everything is still and quiet; Everything is closed; You cannot make efforts anywhere seeing the futility of desires. Now you can't go anywhere. There is a permanent energy store inside. The external world is stable; You are totally present. This is called turning inwards.",

She is not taking any decision on that. Neither stopping him nor verifying him. She is merely observing; Just like she has become a part of the traffic crowd by standing on the road! Or standing on the banks of the pond; Are you looking at the waves rising on the surface of the water? In such a situation, the clownishness of the mind is making him happy. When the mind is jumping here and there, running towards activities here and there, in such a situation it grabs your attention and wants to force you into the game.\r\nAcquiring the skill to distance oneself from the mind is a great blessing. This is called real meditation. In this neither any mantra is chanted nor any vow is made; Rather, in this process one has to keep an eye on the movement of the mind, in the same way as one has to keep an eye on the behavior of any other person. In this way you can meditate by focusing inside your mind.",

Its adverse consequences are not only your present; Your future also gets blocked.\r\nSmall children never look back, they always look forward. There is nothing in his past that he can look back on. All that is there for them is their future. An old man never looks towards the future; Because the only thing left for him in the future is death! They keep ignoring him. They always look backwards at their past. All they have are memories of the past. Today, their past seems beautiful to them; But in the past, when they were living in that situation, they could not enjoy it.\r\nThat person remains young till the last breath of his life, who never clings to his past. His body may have aged but his consciousness always remains healthy and young. Time is constant, time neither goes anywhere nor comes from anywhere. In our common language we often say that time is passing. that time has come or such and such time\r\ngone.\r\nTime has been divided into three parts \u2013 past, present and future, but this division is limited to the mind only. The reason for this is that the present does not stay in front of the mind for long, the present very soon becomes the past. Now whatever is in front of the mind is the future.\r\nThe past is that which does not last long before your eyes; The future is that which is not yet in front of your eyes. The present is what is in front of your eyes, but is slowly slipping away and will soon become the past. What is gone is gone. The past can never be the present. Then what is the meaning of being attached to the past and clinging to it? The same thing can be said about the present also. There is no point in clinging to the present; Because this present of yours will soon become the past. Don't cling to future hopes, expectations, fantasies and plans; Because they will all soon become the present and this present becomes the sliding past; Everything is going to be past or present! Everything is slipping out of your hands. Clinging to all this is only inviting misery. Everything will become the past; Then what will be gained by clinging to it and being sad?\r\nYou let it happen, trying to stop it is meaningless; You have to change your perspective. You let events happen; But don't have special expectations from them. Your expectations, hopes, ambitions are the cause of sorrow and disappointment for you. You remain a witness to objects and events. Instead of clinging to them, stay alert and keep an eye on them. Do not keep your mind attached to them; Always remain in an alert state; This is meditation! You remain calm and inner and keep your eyes on time; Keep an eye on them like an eyewitness, all your anxiety, pain, trouble and tension etc. will end.\r\nThis past, present and future are not periods of time. These are all periods of the mind. Past is what has happened, what is happening is in front, that is present and what is going to happen is not in front, that is future.\r\nWhat you lost in the past cannot be brought back in the present. We don't even know what is going to happen in the future; He is invisible. Therefore, whatever is there, is present. Therefore, do not trouble yourself by worrying about yesterday and tomorrow. Always live in the present. But do not cling to the present either, because the present will also become the past very soon.\r\nWhatever we hope, imagine or plan is for tomorrow. How will tomorrow be? What results will it bring? We don't know him. Yesterday is already past. Everything in our life will be done tomorrow. Every moment of time is slipping away, so do not be sad by remembering the past. Only when you forget your past will you find joy and happiness.",

Dreams are nothing else, when your desires become desires and start dancing in your imagination, at that time you are unable to recognize the reality that lies beneath your imagination! Reality comes to the fore when your dreams are shattered and fantasies become invisible. If you look at an object in the realm of your imagination, you will still not be able to know the true nature of that object.\r\nWhen a beautiful girl passes by your sight, a desire to acquire it arises in your mind. In the same way, if a handsome young man passes by a girl, a desire to establish her authority over him may arise in the girl's mind. After that you naturally do not try to know its reality or its reality. Instead, that desire of yours starts taking the shape of a dream about the girl. Then your next desire is to meet that girl and \u2013 this is where your colorful fantasies begin.\r\nYour colorful imaginations start jumping out of bounds and when reality explodes, your mind colored with dreams gets shattered, this happens to you often. You fall in love with a woman; At that moment the most beautiful thing in the world is in your imagination; But one day suddenly your dream is broken; Imaginations become invisible. The same woman no longer seems as beautiful to you. Now you don't see her the same way you used to see her. You don't believe yourself how you were betrayed by him?\r\nNeither is anyone cheating you, nor can anyone cheat you. The reality is that your desires and your imaginations deceive you; Because this is your created illusion!\r\nA person cannot stay in the world of dreams for long. Sooner or later the reality sets in. This is the reason why all the love affairs that go on become unstable and uncertain. Lovers and lovers are always afraid that what if each other's reality does not come out as per their dreams and imaginations...? And they keep neglecting to know the reality.\r\nThe wife tries to ignore the husband; The husband tries to ignore the wife. They do not try to look at each other directly; Because they are always afraid. They are aware that the world of imagination has disappeared.\r\nIn case of dream breaking, reality emerges in a different way. Husbands no longer look at their wives the way they used to look at them earlier. What happened to them after all? The reality is obvious to both of them. Now the situation is that dreams can never win against reality. The world of dreams falls apart sooner or later. This keeps happening everywhere.\r\nMan always sees different types of dreams, sometimes power\r\nTo be prosperous, sometimes to gain respect and sometimes to reach a higher level! And when he achieves all this, all he gets is disappointment.\r\nIt is human nature to imagine, dream and wish. This is where dreaming and imagining begin. Remember - man also dreams about those things which he does not have. You can dream of your neighbor's beautiful wife, but you cannot dream of your own wife, no matter how beautiful she is. Whatever remains away from us looks beautiful; When we achieve close intimacy with Him, gradually things begin to change, and reality begins to emerge.\r\nStop dreaming; Being awake means giving up the unconscious sleep in which we normally live; Always be awake and alert, see things as they really are.\r\nOnce you see your dream disappearing, because you have now woken up from your dream, at that time the quality of consciousness will arise within you in a new environment. When you recover from the fog of dreams and are in a waking state, you will feel a distinct change when you wake up the next morning. A change that you have never experienced before! You have woken up from your dream state for the first time. The dream has disappeared, because now awareness has come. You have suddenly woken up from the dream. Now both the dream state and the waking state cannot exist together. When awakening comes, the dream automatically disappears, the entire existence becomes awake.",

The habit of such imagination or dreaming is found eternally not only in children but also in writers, poets and lyricists. The roots of such imaginations and dreams lie in the memories of the past. Instead of coming out of these dreams and imaginations and facing the real world, we often wish to live in those dreams. These are just children's dreams and childish imaginations!\r\nBut those dreams of yours and your beautiful imaginations, which you want to hold on to so cruelly; In other words, the utopia in which you want to live slowly slips away and the reality is exposed in its naked form. To stop him permanently is just a child's dream! None of your close friends or associates, even if they are present, want to share your joy gratefully, and even if they wanted to, they would not be able to do so. True joy and real happiness cannot be achieved by solving our problems; It is impossible to get it from anyone else. True happiness and real happiness are within us, which we can achieve by making our inner self full of love and dignity. At that time we can truly share the joy that overflows within us. As soon as the details of dreams and imagination are removed, reality stands before us.",

You add your own illusion or illusion to the form of those things.\r\nThe biggest reason for this is that you are afraid to see things directly in their true form. You know very well that they are not as you see them.\r\nYou think that if you see things as they really are, you won't be able to bear it. That's why to reduce the bitterness of truth, you mix your dreams or imaginations in it. In your dream you have covered a person about whom you think that sweetness must have developed in that person. Is it possible ? No, you are deceiving yourself by thinking so; No one else. The result of this is that you find yourself in a very painful situation. The sad situation before you is beyond your imaginations and dreams. Always be careful about this situation. Don't throw your responsibility on others. Otherwise you will start dreaming some other dream. The situation and the scene present in front of you is projected from your own mind, but you are not able to see it. Your vision does not go towards the projection being made from behind.\r\nTake a theater or cinema hall for example. Your eyes remain fixed only on the screen. The movie you are watching is not actually on the screen. It is the projection of shadow and light by the projector from behind, which appears alive on the screen. Your brain remains behind many such objects and keeps playing the role of a projector. You are always looking at others, because the other person is a screen for you! When you are deeply in love with someone, that person is extremely beautiful and incomparable to you; But when you hate that person, he becomes the ugliest person in the world. Perhaps you are not aware of this or do not realize how the same person, who was very beautiful, becomes ugly?\r\nIn reality, whatever we see is external. We either do not try to reach reality or try to get away from it. Our mind is behind all matters, we use the mind like a projector. We always see before others, because there are other people on the screen.\r\nWhen we see something beautiful, we do not think that where there is beauty, there is also flaw. When we love a woman, we find her beautiful. But when the same woman criticizes us on something, then she looks ugly to us. Now the question arises that how can the same person be so beautiful and so ugly?\r\nWhat I mean to say is that no matter how difficult and complex a situation in life appears from the outside, it is not necessary that it is the same from the inside. The role of our mind is more important behind all this. Happiness and sorrow, good and bad, beautiful and ugly, all these are the choices of our mind.\r\nWhen you are in love with someone, that person becomes a garden of beautiful roses for you, there is not even a trace of thorns anywhere. When you dislike that person, start hating him, the roses become invisible, disappear, if there are any left, there are only thorns! And just ugliness; Which you can't see! Have you ever carefully considered where the beautiful roses disappeared in a single minute?\r\nIf you look carefully, you will realize that the center of events is not the person or the screen you see. The reality is that you are the one projecting something. When you project love, that person seems loved; When you project hatred on the same person, that person appears ugly. Don't use your brain to see reality with your mind's eye.\r\nIt's up to your mind to interpret things. Therefore, to know the reality or truth of any thing, it is necessary to immediately study your point of view. Don't use your brain, because the root of all problems is your mind.\r\nYou should see small things for their true nature without putting your mind to it. If you look at a flower, just look at it. Don't say 'Wow! so so beautiful!' Or 'Oops! Very ugly!' Although your mind will feel uncomfortable doing this. But you naturally keep your mind separate. Gradually your ability to discern the truth will increase.",

There is a feeling of hostility. Whatever prayer and meditation he does is a strategy for his own protection.\r\nA person who has faith knows how to let go. A person with faith knows how to surrender. A person with faith knows how to flow with the flow of the river without pushing. He flows as far as the current takes him. He has so much courage and confidence that he can go anywhere with the flowing current. A person who remains fearful and scared does not have the capacity to surrender. Only a man of strong spirit and strong will can surrender, give up everything; Because he has confidence in himself, he is extremely self-confident and can make sacrifices. He has no fear of any kind. He can find the unknown thing, know its reality; Because he has experience of such strange and dangerous journeys. He has the courage to face dangers.\r\nThe life of a person who has faith and trust in others is always full of dangers and troubles. Danger is his refuge; Insecurity is security for him. He wants to reveal the reality. For this he wants to go to the end of existence or sink into the depths of existence. He wants to know more about existence and want to know himself. A person who is strong and capable from within is always ready to surrender himself. He knows that he has no fear in doing so. He considers himself a part of existence. Therefore he does not consider himself a stranger. He considers existence as his everything. Only in existence lies his identity and his existence, otherwise he is nothing! He knows that no one else can play the role he is going to play for survival. That is why he is always ready to search for something in the darkness.\r\nThere are many things which can be achieved by making efforts, but there are also many things which cannot be achieved even by making efforts. Among the things which can be achieved through efforts are worldly wealth, power, respect and prestige etc. Among the things which cannot be achieved even with efforts are love, prayer, meditation, truth etc. One should learn the method of waiting. One must also learn how to abstain from striving! A person must learn how to surrender himself.

Sometimes it flows towards the north, and sometimes it flows towards the south.

No matter where the river flows, its only goal is the sea!\r\nExpecting to establish uniformity or identity in the minds of people or the uniformity hidden within them is not a part of the society but is related to the entire universe.

Society itself has created all the morals or rules, which are stable at one place. This is the reason why moral people and societies have existed together for centuries.

The living person dies by drowning in the river water; Whereas the body of a dead person floats on the surface of water. What happened after all?

If you are alert and aware, you are automatically controlled and disciplined.\r\nNever apply pressure. Unnecessary control or restraint is a great misfortune for a person. No matter how beautiful any control may appear externally, its internal reaction is very terrible. Under the burden of such double or control, the person abandons his natural nature due to stress and the flow of life starts getting blocked. Freedom has its own discipline; Have your own control.

Unless you are freed from the pressure of controls imposed by external forces, the creative power inherent within you cannot become active.\r\nTherefore, there is a need to adopt the path of a self-controlled, disciplined, free and independent life.",

Therefore, love is the real foundation of all types of morality, not command, advice or constitutional law! Moralists are ready to face all difficulties. They are ready to face all kinds of reactions, obstacles and adverse situations. They are ready to observe all kinds of strict prohibitions and strict self-control, so that they can appear high in the society. In this they get joy and prestige. Such people consider themselves holier and higher than other people of the society, such moralists have only one feeling in their mind that you all are sinners and I am a saint.\r\nThe characteristics of a true saint are completely different. He is not a moralist. He knows how to forgive. He has his own experience of being forgiven again and again. He knows the limitations of man. Because he has endured a lot while passing through those boundaries. He can forgive; Because he has a deep understanding.\r\nThe moralist does not understand. There is no real information about the actual situation. He can never forgive. Satisfy your ego; He has the illusion of proving himself superior and considering others as inferior. A person who is not moral has to face two types of difficulties. The first difficulty he faces comes from outside. Because by being unethical he starts losing the respect of people. Honor and respect are most precious in this world; Because it confirms people's ego. The moment a person loses respect and honor received in society, the ego gets injured. The second difficulty for the immoral person is internal. When the respect of an immoral person starts getting destroyed in the outside society, at that time he experiences inner terror. The conscience of the conscience ends; Because a person's respect and good thoughts are all created by the external society.\r\nIf you are moral, then understand that there are two types of pressure on you from society, external and internal. In this way you are forced to be crushed between two stones, you have no other option than living this double life. Even if there is a path, it is not for cowards. A coward can never be immoral and an immoral person can never be a coward.\r\nThe moment the stream of society meets existence, you are associated with society; The moment the coherence of society ceases to exist, you become distant from society. But a true moral person does not care about all these things. He is always ready to face the difficulties that arise in his life. A truly moral person takes his decisions based on his own awareness. He does not care about religions, sects, sermons etc. He considers the morality taught in religions as an irony. The morality established by religions is different from the morality prescribed for the individual in general. Common morality originates from self-awareness.

For that he is trying to fight the river itself; Because fighting is an expression of a person's dissatisfaction. A person's ego is satisfied by constant fights and challenges.

You put yourself (your ego) aside; Don't come in between. If you learn as much as you can about how to push yourself aside during this process, then you will have learned everything!

This is such an innocent mentality, where there is no line of demarcation between deception and deceit, lie and deceit, respect and insult, hatred and love, good and bad etc. As the same child grows older, he gradually starts considering himself the smartest and most intelligent person due to the knowledge he receives through various mediums and institutions. There is a situation when his stubbornness or his false ego becomes his personality. He cannot accept anyone else's dominance over him. A person keeps carrying unnecessary burden throughout his life by piling up the garbage of his borrowed artificial knowledge, thoughts, theories etc. in his mind.\r\nPeople who have acquired knowledge remain very cautious, their personality does not come out openly. In the same way, all of you have become intelligent and clever. You read books, took knowledge of spirituality, studied in temples, mosques and churches, you have acquired all this knowledge through other means. Whatever kind of knowledge you have acquired.

There are many types of resolutions and options in the mind. Everything remains in disarray. Where are you at that time? What are you doing? In this way, you are pushed into internal conflict by having your mind confused about where are you going etc. In such a situation you will not realize that your mentality is innocent.

You can either become absorbed in existence or you can become separate from existence in yourself. Both things are not possible together.

The flow of life continues to flow forward.\r\nInitially it becomes difficult for a person to guess how he can survive outside the zero state. Trees and plants grow by coming out of the state of emptiness; The moon and stars keep moving; Existence exists outside the void; But there is no problem and no difficulty there. It is only man who loses his existence by moving away from the mind! If you remain at one with the mind, you will become a reliable and trustworthy person. But in reality your connection with the mind turns into disconnection; Because the flow of life has moved forward. The mind is always occupied with experiences that have already occurred; Whereas life is always open to experiences that have not happened yet. Then how is the union of the two possible? After this, gradually the mind becomes completely closed within itself. Not only this; The mind becomes frightened after looking at life. After this, life becomes a burden on the mind. Why does the mind get scared looking at life? Because the mind knows that if you look at life, you will be proven wrong. It is better to close your eyes and not look at life at all. Don't listen about life; As if you are a victim of deafness!\r\nLife is a continuous flow of birth. Every moment it dies and takes a new birth, but you continue to carry the same old mind. You cannot fit in anywhere in any situation. You don't fit in with anyone, and there is some difficulty where you are. If you become a flow or river of formless consciousness, everything will automatically fit into place. Then you will fit in with life and life will fit in with you. Suddenly everything will be fine and then life will not seem like a burden.",

Honesty is not a method, a system or a device and if it is a method or a political system, then it is not honesty.\r\nThere are three words in the English language which have a deep relationship with each other. Those words are Policy, Politeness and Politics. These three words originate from the same root. The conclusion of all three is the same. People with political background use these three words very skillfully.\r\nWhen you meet a friend, why do you smile and shake hands? What is the need for this? If you don't feel good about smiling, then why do you smile? Because you have to do it. This is a policy, this is politics!

When they gain power, they become free; Because the common man does not have the power to stop them. As soon as one gets strength, the real face of the person comes to the fore.\r\nPower or strength never corrupts any person. On the contrary, it is the corrupt people who are eager to gain power. When they get power; So they misuse power to fulfill their desires and aspirations!\r\nA person may be extremely polite. When he seeks political office or power, he displays greater humility; Which we know very well. We also know that the person has been simple and humble throughout his life; That's why we vote for him. When he gains power, he is never the same again! People wonder how power corrupts!\r\nIn reality that humility was a pretense, a false ostentation! He was humble because; Because he was weak; He had no strength; There was no power. He was afraid that powerful people might crush him. His politeness, he had a policy; He had politics! Now he does not need to be afraid. Now no one can destroy it by crushing it. Now he can come forward with his real face. Now he looks corrupt!\r\nThe company owner or office boss harasses you; If it hurts you, you will come home and trouble your wife. An irritated wife will take out her anger on her child and scold him. Will reprimand. If the child is old-fashioned, he will vent his anger on the toy and break it. Well, this sequence will continue.

You have to understand the whole array of sin and criminal sentiment. Unless you create criminal feelings in a person, you cannot force that person to adopt a certain ideology or accept any concept.\r\nBut, once you instill the feeling of guilt in a person's mind, then understand that you have taken from that person all the courageous power that was there in him. By creating a sense of guilt in that person's mind, you have destroyed the courageous potential inherent in him. You killed that person's human potential! He can never be independent or free. The criminal feeling in his mind will force him to become dependent; He will take refuge in some Messiah, some religious leader or an angel of God; Because his guilt will continue to put pressure on him.\r\nIt is a common thing to create a feeling of guilt in a person's mind. Start calling mistakes and mistakes 'sins'. It is human nature to make mistakes or make mistakes; But calling it a 'sin' is a different thing. If a child adds two and two and writes five instead of four in arithmetic, then he is called careless or foolish, it is not called a sin. There is no feeling of guilt in the mind of that child.\r\nThe emergence of criminal sentiments is not a natural matter or an easy event.\r\nIt is created by priests, mullahs and pastors etc. By creating this criminal spirit, they show human bravery.

Never use the word guilt, as it takes deep roots in your unconscious mind. You will not find guilt in any animal; That is why he remains beautiful and innocent.\r\nIdeals corrupt man. Once you set out to establish an ideal, understand this - you will never be able to feel comfortable; You will never be able to experience peace and satisfaction, whether at home or outside. Your dissatisfaction will remain a shadow of the ideal you want to fulfill. The more the feeling of dissatisfaction increases within you, the more your ideal will move away from you.\r\nIf you are not dissatisfied with yourself, if you accept yourself as you are, your ideal can be established immediately; may be complete; Because perfection is your nature.\r\nApart from the feeling of guilt created by the abbots, pundits, mullahs or priests, there is another type of crime which is created by some other force. This type of crime makes sense in itself! Such a feeling of guilt arises in your mind only when you are dissatisfied with your present; When you think there's more to life than this, but you're not working hard enough to get it! In such a situation, a feeling of guilt will arise in your mind. You will start to feel as if you have stunted your own growth. You will start thinking of yourself as incompetent, lazy, unconscious etc. It is from here that a kind of crime is created in your mind. This crime is of a different type altogether. This thought arises in your mind that despite being capable, you could not utilize your potential; So you become plagued with a kind of guilt.\r\nThere is another type of guilt, which, although spiritual, is not related to any temple, mosque or church.

He is always ready to become a slave. He never creates trouble or betrays. He can never refuse. He is a faithful follower and a devoted slave or slave. Such consciousness is very rare in humans.\r\nThe lion is a symbol of change; Symbolizes transformation; And it is a symbol of revolution by turning upside down! Revolution or transformation begins with a sense of purity. The need for a person remains in the camel's consciousness; Who takes him and tells him 'you have to do this'. A camel needs ten types of commands. He needs all religions, all priests and all religious texts; Because he does not trust himself. He lacks courage, his soul is dead; No longing for freedom; There is no excitement. He is always obedient.\r\nWhereas Leo loves his freedom. He is always yearning for freedom. He has the desire to destroy every kind of prison and bondage. Leo does not need any leader or leader. That is sufficient in itself. He cannot allow anyone to tell him, 'You have to do this.' It is insulting to Leo to do so. Only he can say that 'I will definitely do it.'\r\nBut a lion does not have the height at which a human is. Only then can he be at such a high peak; When one transforms oneself and feels like a child. One\r\nThe child is innocent. He is not obedient. But he doesn't disobey either. He is not a believer, but not a disbeliever either. He is pure and trustworthy. His eyes are pure and free from defects. It is sacred, acceptable, respected and liberated for the entire existence. Pride is man's self-respect. Pride is a man's false reputation. No one should consider it synonymous with self-respect. Ego takes away your self-respect or your importance; Takes away your majesty; Because ego depends on others, on others' thoughts and what people say. Ego is fleeting. People's intentions and thoughts can change and destroy the ego.\r\nWhen we feel like we are losing life, we start rejecting the demands of others. We separate ourselves from the crowd. After separating from the crowd, we become alone and proud. He is our truth and He is also the creativity of truth. In the end, there is awakening from somewhere within us, there is neither frustration nor disappointment in the awakening that occurs within us. There is a complete awakening. If we allow that to happen, a new revolution will be born. If there is revolution then change will definitely come.\r\nThe choice of camel as a symbol symbolizes a lower level of consciousness, which is probably more appropriate. Minimal consciousness is a sign of man's paralysis; It likes slavery more. A person having such thinking remains afraid of fulfilling his responsibilities. A man with minimal consciousness is ignorant and unintelligent; has been inattentive and dormant; Because till now the burden of external knowledge has been kept on him. This burden of knowledge has been like nectar of faith for that person; Loyalty and trust have been like poison; Symbolizes a commitment to never say 'no' to any command. The person who cannot say 'no' after hearing any command, loses his pride and self-respect. 'Yes' has no meaning for him. Only the one who is capable can say 'No'! Therefore, become a lion and not a burden-carrying camel. The camel has to be transformed into a lion, who likes to die, does not like the life of slavery. Saying 'yes' is contrary to his nature. A child neither knows anything about a camel nor about a lion! He is innocent, it is his nature to forget. There is purity and innocence in his 'yes'. He can say 'no' with full probability. He has no fear, he has complete trust.\r\nThis is the biggest transformation of man.",

He always lives in an illusion and thinks of himself as the top of the mountain, but he is so dependent on the opinions of others that he can muster up some courage with great difficulty. Something like a lion emerges from the camel. When we feel like we are wasting life, or wasting it, we reject the demands of others; Say 'no'.\r\nBy now we have passed that crowd; All alone and proudly... with the truth within me roaring like a lion. But life does not end here!\r\nUltimately there is a transformation in the child's appearance. There is neither any acceptance or consent nor any betrayal or disturbance in this process. Instead of all this, he is a symbol of innocence, free will, truth and simplicity. It is from here that you can transform yourself with your gradual emergence.",

When you are surrounded by deep darkness from all sides, you have to keep the light on, all these situations become helpful for you.\r\nI don't believe in what other people call meditation. You do it for ten minutes or twenty minutes. After this you fulfill your normal needs for 24 hours. After twenty-four hours you meditate again for twenty minutes. For me, meditation is like breathing. So whatever you are doing, whatever you are, do it with utmost awareness. For example, when you raise your hand, it does not require any consciousness. In that you do it according to your habit; But this action can be done with full awareness.

Unless you do this, that is, if you do not chew your food, then you should understand that you are placing an unnecessary burden on your overall digestive system. There are no teeth in your stomach. A person should chew each morsel of food forty-two times. This cycle of life and death continues continuously. This life has not been found for the first time.

Now you neither have to look backward nor forward! Whoever you are, wherever you are; Are in your present! The present is the only existence.\r\nPay attention - when you are in a state of intensity and completeness in a particular emotion, your selfishness disappears there. Suppose you are in love with someone. There is intensity and depth in your love; So in those moments your selfishness disappears. There you are alone; The same thing also applies to emotions like anger, hatred, lust etc. In such extreme moments, only your emotions like love, hatred, anger etc. remain there. Love becomes invisible in front of 'self' or 'selfishness'. Selfishness occurs only when your mind remains incomplete in any object or action. The feeling of incompleteness is your selfishness.\r\nIf you are completely engaged in painting, playing guitar, dancing, singing or any such art, at that time you will immediately feel that you are not there. There only your art practice remains. Such moments may have passed in your life when, knowingly or unknowingly, you were observing the beautiful view of the sunset and you forgot everything else and got engrossed in that view. At that moment you are no longer aware of your selfishness. At that time you are not present there and have gone somewhere else. At that time you become so united with existence that your ego of 'I' or 'self' no longer exists. Whatever is left after this, you can freely use it for beauty.\r\nExperience, the experience of love, is the experience of pleasant music only. The experience of such moments is natural, which comes and disappears on its own.\r\nA small child always lives in 100 degrees. During that time his every activity is 100% complete. If he starts hating you, he hates you 100%; If he loves, then in totality...! But in the next moment it changes completely. There is not even a moment's delay in changing his attitude. He changes so much in a moment that he doesn't worry about it in any way. Just a moment ago he was sitting on your lap, trying to tell you how much he loves you! But then something like this happens, 'I' 'I will never come to you again'. At that time, look into the eyes of that child, he has the same feeling of distance towards you.\r\nAdopt an approach of living every moment of life to the fullest; So that you don't have to carry the burden of memories of incompleteness throughout your life. When you live a fulfilling life, there will be a coordination of intensity in it and when it ends, you will not dream of getting it again, an overall fulfilling, satisfying and intense way of life can give you only the present and not the past or the future! In other words, the present is your living and complete moment.",

The result of these possibilities is that water automatically evaporates at a temperature of 100 degrees centigrade and again at zero temperature the same water gets converted into ice. These are all natural phenomena, which keep happening continuously. In the same way darkness is natural and light is also natural. Rising up is natural and falling down is also natural. What I mean to say is that there are infinite possibilities inherent in nature.\r\nWe always stand at a crossroads through which infinite paths emerge. Now the most important thing is which path we choose! Our ability to choose the path is a precious gift of nature! But the most important thing is which path we choose!

It depends on your ability and interest whether you want to die or live. Possibilities remain in both cases.

To see the lives of others and their lifestyle, whereas the truth is that the picture seen on the screen is not life; They are acting for you. You see those actors, not their real lives! Everything is a lie, unreal!\r\nTo know the truth of something, participation in it is essential. The moment you consider it necessary to see something, to know it you become its participant, dancing and watching dance are two different situations. To know dance it is necessary to dance.

Our stress does not come from anywhere, we are the only reason for its creation. Can you imagine that unless you set the alarm on the clock, the sun will not rise? Everything continues the same. All you have to do is remain stress-free by keeping yourself separate from that dynamic cycle of events.",

Its destiny is to keep flowing continuously; Life itself is a journey. There is no end to it. Where there is a pause; Where the destination of life, the ultimate goal of life is found; Where life's journey comes to a halt; That is death!\r\nThere is no destination for the journey of life. Life is a continuous journey. Your entire life is a journey! This journey has been going on for thousands and millions of years. Suppose you reach your ultimate goal? Have you ever considered this possibility? Suppose you suddenly meet God? At that time you have no words to say to God, and God also has nothing to say!\r\nThis is the end result of your life journey till now. This is the final result of your journey i.e. death. Everything is over! You burnt yourself out unnecessarily. There is no final destination anywhere; And even if such confusion exists, it has no value! Whatever is found in the journey of life, what is its value, what is its quality; Don't ask it. Enjoy every moment, everything. Be it a pilgrimage or a country trip, know this very well that there is no end to the journey of life! Enjoy the journey. The journey will continue, the flow of life will always be dynamic. There is no such place where the path ends!",

Whenever this card is studied, it will clearly indicate that this is the time for change and mobility. Mobility includes travel from one place to another; Then from there the journey to the next destination! Apart from this, there can also be internal mobility, sometimes here and sometimes\r\nThere!\r\nWhatever be the problem, this card definitely assures that your journey will be smooth and simple and will also provide you with bold opportunities for growth. In this you do not need to struggle or make any additional arrangements. This travel card also reminds us to accept and welcome whatever new comes in the journey of life. Just like when we travel to another country, where the culture and environment is different; But later we get used to it. In the same way, always have a receptive and accepting approach in the journey of life. Invite new experiences and new friends into your life.",

When you become neutral by moving away from the events happening around you, you see that millions and crores of events keep happening in this entire existence, which you cannot even calculate. It is not that these events are happening right now; These have already been happening, but till now you have not noticed them. The reason for this is that you were busy in achieving other tasks and objectives, that is why you never paid attention to them. While the birds continue to sing, their chirping continues as before, but you remain untouched by it! Trees and plants continue to flourish and flourish in the same way. The scheduled events of creation continue to happen as before.\r\nYou have to come out of this situation. You have to free yourself from the grip of busyness. Where does your path lead? There is always only one thought roaming in your mind that in the future you may reach some goal. But the question arises that your life is here, then why are you waiting for the future instead of thinking about the present? Why do you ruin your present in hopes of the future? This is very suicidal for you.\r\nThe pace of life is very slow. Why don't you feel it? Looks like you are unconscious, otherwise postponing your present activities and leaving it to the future is suicidal for you. Whatever is in front of you in life, complete it right now; Don't leave it for tomorrow or the future. As easy and simple as it is to become active, it is equally easy to become inactive. There are millions and crores of people on this earth who are constantly active, dynamic, always active day and night without stopping, they neither have time to rest nor to take a break. There remains a kind of impatience or restlessness in them. That is why they keep changing their attitudes. It is not possible for them to sit idle. They always try to achieve something and keep themselves busy in it. In a way their life remains disturbed and restless. Due to their constant busyness, they gradually drag themselves towards madness.\r\nBe active, make circumstances favorable to you; But don't be restless and anxious. When your activity is complete, in which you have endured much disturbance; After that you take complete rest. Do the most work at the time when you are busy with some work; While you are playing, keep playing; while you are resting, keep worldly problems aside and take complete rest; Forget the whole world.",

But their path is uncomfortable and unnatural. We created those paths and spent our entire lives busy trying to operate them as per our wish and achieve success.\r\nWe have forgotten that the events of the entire creation, the entire existence keep happening automatically. They cannot be stopped or diverted. Don't make life a time table; Feel free to walk among the roses... enjoy the mountain beauty and music, the whole existence is with you!",

                "card_english_content": "Whenever there is a hindrance in the flow of life, wherever there is a hindrance, the strings of the mind get scattered; Thoughts get scattered. Whatever you accept, or accept, is in the conscious state, whatever you reject, goes into the unconscious. This happens only when there is too much pressure and obstruction on your mind. The social garbage that has been rejected by the society is what you are unconsciously going to throw on others. But in doing so you must remember that whatever you reject; Even if you throw it away, it becomes a strong part of your life. In this conflict of the mind, you start the process of repression by rejecting the conscious thoughts and its ill effects remain permanent in the unconscious.\r\nContinuously suppressing thoughts can create a dangerous situation! Psychologists say that eighty percent of human diseases originate from suppression of emotions. Who knows, many incidents of cardiac arrest occur due to continuous suppression of anger. By continuously suppressing the feeling of hatred the heart becomes poisonous. The way to transform the impulse of emotions is different.\r\nIn the process of controlling the emotions, you block their speed by putting pressure on them; Whereas in the process of transformation the emotions are expressed and made clear, the flow of emotions is not blocked. But keep one thing in mind that do not vent your emotions on anyone else. If you do this, the consequences can be fatal for you. On any other occasion, if an emotional state of anger arises within you, the way to transform it is to walk away from there and circumambulate the house seven times. After that, sit under a tree and enjoy the beauty of nature. Where has the anger gone now?\r\nYou did not try to suppress your anger nor did you try to control it. You did not even try to vent your anger on anyone else. If you try to throw or vent your anger on another person, a chain will be formed from there. The reason for this is that if the person on whom you are venting your anger turns out to be as foolish as you and as unconscious as you, then a revolving chain will start from there; The result of which will be that your inner mind will become anxious, frustrated, restless and stressed, which can cause serious diseases. If you make the foolish mistake of venting out your anger on someone else and that person turns out to be as foolish as you, then in response that person will vent out even more anger on you. The result will be the creation of enmity; The end of which becomes difficult.\r\nHow terrible anger is for us, but generally people are not fully aware of its ill effects. You don't need to vent your anger on anyone else; It is better to go straight to the bathroom than to vent your anger on someone else; Go for a long walk somewhere; You will find that inner activity can bring you back to normal by transforming your emotions. To avoid the disaster of anger, you do not need to suppress, control or block your emotions or feelings.\r\nYou do not need any special caution or awareness to control your anger. You need to be intuitively mindful, so that process becomes your nature. Then you will not need any pressure or repression to control the flood of your emotions. The society keeps imposing control on every step, the society never teaches you to be aware or awake every moment of your life. The reason is clear, a waking person has a broader perspective. Through narrow-mindedness he keeps himself aloof. On the contrary, it becomes a permanent mentality of a person who strictly controls his emotions or feelings. Society suggests various types of controls on such people. Society advises you to stay locked in a cave; In which there is no hole to peek out!\r\nRemember one thing here - when nothing can go out from inside you; Neither can anything come in from outside; You have closed yourself off in this way; So in such a situation no beauty from outside can touch you. Eyes cannot perceive beauty. In a way you are living in an emotional state. In a way, you are bearing the brunt of the unconscious state and - all this is the bad result of suppressing anger and forceful control. Your consciousness develops along with your awareness. If you repress, control and inhibit your emotions; So such a life, while alive, is like a dead one.",

By blocking or suppressing the emotions, a power gradually gets blocked, whose explosion can be very frightening.\r\nThe only message of this card is to receive some solace from outside before the power within you explodes! It is also necessary to find its solution, so that the way to transform the tension or unrest that is becoming explosive inside you can be found in time. To get rid of your anger, stress or anxiety, you can use your explosive power. You can transform yourself by hitting the pillow, running in the garden or circling the house, you don't need to mess with anyone for that!",

The effort to make the mind the basis of every type of education is ongoing and the argument is that the vibration of overall power is based on the mind only, mathematicians, engineers, doctors etc. are born from sharp minds or powerful minds only.\r\nBut, according to the opinion of philosophers and psychoanalysts, come out of the power of the mind and recognize the source of your inner power from where all kinds of educational tendencies get their strength. This is the same power from which the whole world derives educational energy, brain energy, power of thoughts, imaginative power and thinking power. The brain uses these powers. If you use the total energy only through your mind, you will not experience the power within you and your self-awareness.\r\nThat power is always present within you, that power keeps throbbing in the middle of your body. Keeps pulsating. This power does not move anywhere else; Neither in the mind, nor in the heart! The source of this power is so sufficient that all the organs of the body receive power from there. There is immense energy contained in this power. It can be transformed towards light, it can be transformed towards love; There can be a transformation towards kindness and creativity. This power can take many shapes; But first you have to learn how to access that power source. When you need brain power, let that power flow to the brain; If love is needed, then let it flow towards the heart.\r\nRemember one more thing \u2013 you don't have to keep thinking twenty-four hours continuously. When you stop thinking, you discover unlimited power and adaptability.\r\nThe glow of that power source is within you; Not outside you. If you search for it outside, your search will be in vain.

This power is just like the Sun nourishes us personally by giving us light and energy and makes our life a storehouse of power. There is a pure source of energy present within us, whose heartbeat we keep feeling. With that power we can achieve anything. Whether we are active or wish to rest, that power always welcomes us.

' जब कि यह बात अलग है कि हमारा वह विचार बाद में इस स्तर पर आ पहुँचे कि ऐसा करने में कोई त्रुटि हो सकती हैं; कोई भूल हो सकती है; ऐसी स्थिति में मस्तिष्क पर जो भी भार है, विघ्न और बाधाएँ हैं, उन्हें उतार फेंकिए। ये परिबल आप को एक दायरे में बाँध रखे हैं। यदि ऐसा नहीं करेंगे, तो आपका जीवन अशान्ति, असफलता और जटिल समस्याओं से भर उठेगा।\r\nआपको चाहिए कि प्राचीन जीवनप्रणाली तथा पुरानी मान्यताओं को त्यागकर, नये जोश तथा नई उमंग से जीवन की नई राह पर प्रगति करें। इस Breakthrough (ब्रेकथ्रू) के जरिए अपना नया जीवन खुशियों से भर दें ।\r\nजिस समय आप एक कार चलाते हैं, तो आपको उसका गियर चेन्ज करना पड़ता है। जब आप गियर बदलते हैं, तो एक ऐसा क्षण आता है कि वह गियर कुछ देर के लिए न्यूट्रल हो जाता हैं। अब उसी स्थिति में उसे घुमना होता है। न्युट्रल गियर का मतलब होता है, बिना गियर का । एक गियर के बाद दूसरे गियर पर आना । उसी प्रकार से आपके मस्तिष्क में भी विचारों के परिवर्तन की प्रक्रिया में एक न्युट्रल स्थिति पैदा होती हैं । वहाँ से आप नई चुनौतियों को स्वीकार करके, एक नये मार्ग की ओर चलने का साहस प्राप्त करते हैं । प्रत्येक प्रगति की प्रक्रिया में असफलता की सारी संभावनाएँ छिपी होती हैं। जब कि आपके हृदय में सफलता का अंकुरण हो चुका होता है। अतः आपकी प्रगति का मार्ग प्रकाशमय हैं।",

'હા' કહેવું તેના સ્વભાવની વિરુદ્ધ છે. બાળકને ન તો ઊંટ વિશે કંઈ ખબર હોય કે ન સિંહ વિશે! તે નિર્દોષ છે, ભૂલી જવું તેનો સ્વભાવ છે. તેની 'હા'માં શુદ્ધતા અને નિર્દોષતા છે. તે સંપૂર્ણ સંભાવના સાથે 'ના' કહી શકે છે. તેને કોઈ ડર નથી, તેને સંપૂર્ણ વિશ્વાસ છે.\r\nઆ માણસનું સૌથી મોટું પરિવર્તન છે.",
